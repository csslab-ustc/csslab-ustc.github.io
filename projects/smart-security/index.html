                <h3>SmartSec: The Smart Contract Security Project</h3>
                <div class="split-line"></div>
                <h5>Overview:</h5>
                <p>
                    Smart contracts are programs that executed inside a
                    peer-to-peer network where nobody has special
                    authority over the execution, thus have been widely
                    used to implement functionalities such as tokens of value,
                    ownership, voting, finance, management, healthcare,
                    and internet of things (IoTs).
                    Once the smart contract code is written,
                    it is compiled into bytecode by the contract compilers,
                    and stored on the Ethernet blockchain platform for
                    execution. When
                    a node in the network sends a transaction to the
                    address where the smart contract resides or when
                    certain conditions are
                    satisfied, the smart contract code will be triggered.
                    Then the smart contract will automatically execute,
                    independently and
                    automatically, on each network node in a prescribed
                    manner. Because smart contracts mostly involves monetary transactions,
                    security is of paramount importance.

                <p>
                    In recent years, many vulnerabilities and security issues
                    have been detected or reported for smart
                    contracts. These security issues include integer overflows,
                    reentrancy, unauthorized access, external calls,
                    arithmetic overflows, unsafe type inference, costly
                    loops, overpowered owners, and so on. These vulnerabilities
                    often lead to
                    considerable losses. For example, the famous the Dao
                    attack stole 3.6 million Ether coins by exploiting a contractual
                    vulnerability in recursive calls, which eventually
                    led to a hard fork of Ether.

                    The goal of the SmartSec project is to investigate the
                    security of smart contract. To be specific, this
                    project aims to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>perform thorough study on vulnerabilities of
                        smart contract in the wild, and investigate
                        the common bug patterns;</li>
                    <li>perform empirical study on mainstream smart
                        contract toolchains，discuss and reveal the
                        security issues on them；</li>
                    <li>develop practical tools to detect and fix
                        vulnerabilities in smart contracts. </li>
                </ul>
