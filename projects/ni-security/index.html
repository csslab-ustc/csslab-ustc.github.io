<h2>The Native Interface Security Project</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    The native function interfaces (NFIs) are ubiquitous in many real
    languages and software systems, and are becoming indispensable components.
    For instance, Java introduces the Java Native Interfaces (JNIs)
    standards, Python introduces the Python/C API, and Julia introducing
    the <tt>ccall</tt> syntax. NFIs bring many key advantages
    to the whole software development process: first, it makes it
    easy to develop software components using multiple languages, to
    take the full expressiveness of different languages, for instance,
    in an AI system, many computation density components can be
    implemented more efficiently in C/C++ instead of Python; second, it
    make it possible to reuse many existing software systems without
    reinventing the wheels; finally, NFIs make software development
    more modular.
</p>

<p>
    Although NFIs are very important in real systems, it brings grand
    challenges to guarantee the safety and security of such systems.
    Due to the intrinsic differences between different languages: the
    memory model, the data layout, the calling convention, the memory
    management, the locking strategies, among many others, it's
    very challenging to write reliable multilingual software systems.
    Taking Python as an example, Python has built-in support for
    garbage collection, whereas C does not have, so an object allocated
    in C has to be reclaimed manually. Failure to do so may
    result in a memory leaking. As one can imagine, this is rather
    a tedious and error-prone process.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of this project is to investigate the security of
    the native function interfaces. To be specific, this project aims to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        perform thorough study on vulnerabilities of current NFIs, and
        investigate the common bug patterns;
    </li>
    <li>
        study effective techniques to fix these vulnerabilities automatically (APR);
    </li>
    <li>
        develop practical system prototypes.
    </li>
</ul>
