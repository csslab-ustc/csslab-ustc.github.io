                    Computation Software</h3>
                <div class="split-line"></div>
                <h5>Overview:</h5>
                <p>
                    Based on molecular dynamics and density functional theory
                    (DFT), the first-principle calculation has become an indispensable part of realms in Chemistry,
                    Biology, material computation and prediction, and condensed matter physics. Multiple quantum
                    chemical calculation software such as Gaussian, SIESTA, VASP, QUANTUM ESPRESSO, and
                    ABACUS are developed to perform molecular dynamics simulation, electronic structure
                    calculation, and produce predictions of materials which includes, but are not limited to their
                    crystal structure, Physical and Chemical properties, Thermodynamic properties, and Mechanical
                    properties. Nevertheless, less effort is made to study potential vulnerabilities in these systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, to fill the gap, we present the general
                    methodology for detecting vulnerabilities in quantum chemical computation programs. Our key
                    idea is to leverage fuzz-based approach via a chemistry oracle. To validate our approach, we
                    designed and implemented the first prototype system: ChemSmith, to detect and understand
                    vulnerabilities in quantum chemical computation software. ChemSmith has several key
                    components: first, it constructs and generates a large spectrum of random structured data
                    following the Forms Data Format (FDF) files that can be accepted by computation software.
                    Second, ChemSmith incorporates domain-specific chemical knowledge database, to guarantee
                    and validate special-purpose chemical properties such as value ranges or data symmetry. Third,
                    ChemSmith leverages the key insight of error feedback fuzzing by monitoring program
                    executions, resource usage, unusual exceptions and crashes to discover functional
                    vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ChemSmith leverages differential testing approach to ensure the
                    rationality, accuracy, and consistency of results. Finally, any irrational and unexpected result
                    should be automatically detected and manually classified for the purpose of vulnerability
                    analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a long-term perspective, ChemSmith represents the first step towards
                    detecting vulnerabilities in quantum chemical computation software, thus making the whole
                    ecosystem more reliable and trustworthy.
                </p>
