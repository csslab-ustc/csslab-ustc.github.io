                <h2>NexaC: Design and Implementation of the Next Generation GPU Compiler</h2>
                <div class="split-line"></div>
                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>
                    With the exponential growth in technology and data, traditional CPUs have increasingly grappled with limitations in addressing compute-intensive tasks. 
                    While originally designed for graphic rendering, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) possess an innate parallelism architecture, making them highly 
                    effective for non-graphics parallel computations. This realization has given rise to the widespread study of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs).
                    Over recent years, a multitude of studies and real-world applications have underscored the immense value of GPGPUs in both academic research and the industrial sector.
                    Fields such as machine learning, deep learning, computational fluid dynamics, and bioinformatics, to name a few, have witnessed the transformative potential of GPGPUs. 
                    These units have empowered scientists and engineers to tackle problems that were previously deemed intractable.
                    
               </p>
                <p>
                    While, despite the immense computational benefits of GPGPUs, they also usher in intricate challenges related to programming and optimization. 
                    Particularly glaring are the gaps in research areas like compiler design, optimization, and security for GPGPUs â€“ realms that are presently underexplored.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The DexaC initiative endeavors to address these prominent gaps, placing a distinct emphasis on the enhancement of GPGPU compiler research, 
                    encompassing architectural design, algorithmic optimization, and robust security mechanisms. To be specific, this project aims to: :
