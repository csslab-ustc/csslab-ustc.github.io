<h1>Lab 6: Debugger</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Programs normally contain bugs, even after extensive code reviewing
    or thorough testing. Debuggers are powerful and valuable tools
    to help developers
    catch bugs by executing the target program in a controlled way:
    setting up break points, peeking or modifying
    memory or register states, and recording execution traces, among
    others. Debuggers are indispensable tools for every serious
    developer.
</p>
<p>
    In this lab, you will gain a deep understanding of program debugging
    by implementing a minimal debugger <samp>ssedb</samp>
    similar to the widely-used <samp>gdb</samp> debugger.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files with file
    name <samp>ID-lab-6.zip</samp>
    (e.g., <samp>SA19225789-lab-6.zip</samp>),
    and submit it to
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">Online Teaching Platform</a>.
    The deadline TBA (Beijing time).

<h2>Part B: Introduction to Debugging</h2>
<p>
    In this section, let us start by investigating what is a debugger.
    Debuggers are powerful tools which allow programmers to load and
    run executables,
    to attach to an already running process (even remote ones);
    and perform interesting actions.
</p>
<p>
    In this assignment, you'll learn what's going on under the hood of debugging,
    by implementing a minimal debugger called <samp>ssedb</samp> by yourself. And further,
    you'll understand how anti-debugging techniques can make debugging difficult,
    and how to overwhele these anti-debugging techniques.
</p>
<p>
    Though small, <samp>ssedb</samp> debugger includes many features: loading files, setting up break points,
    stopping and continuing processes, peeking registers and memory, poking memory and registers, etc..
    And finally, <samp>ssedb</samp> is also based-on <samp>ptrace</samp>, as do <samp>gdb</samp>,
    <samp>edb</samp> or <samp>ida pro</samp>, etc..
</p>
<p>
    After completing this assignment, our <samp>ssedb</samp> debugger can achieve the following functions:
</p>

<h3>1. Setting up break points:</h3>
<pre>(ssedb) <kbd>b 0xaddr</kbd></pre>

<p>
    A break point makes your program stop whenever a certain point in the program is reached.
    You can set break points with the break command and its variants , to specify the place where
    your program should stop by exact address in the program.
</p>
<p>
    For example, for this testing program:
</p>
<pre>
    #include&ltstdio.h>
    void print(){
        printf("hi\n");
    }
    int main(){
        printf("hello\n");
        print();
        return 0;
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Compile the testing program file:
</p>
<pre>css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>gcc -static -o hello hello.c</kbd></pre>
<p>
    And then run the debugger on <samp>hello</samp>. If you want to set a break point at the function
    <samp>print</samp>, run this:
</p>
<pre>css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>objdump -d hello > content.txt</kbd></pre>
<p>
    and figure out the address of the function <samp>print</samp>, suppose that address is <samp>0xaddr</samp>
    on your machine. Now in the <samp>ssedb</samp>, you set up a break point on address
    <samp>0xaddr</samp> by typing (remember this address must be in hexadecimal, which has a leading <samp>0x</samp>):
</p>
<pre>(ssedb) <kbd>b 0xaddr</kbd></pre>
<p>
    Find the location of the function <samp>print</samp> in the file <samp>content.txt</samp>:
</p>
    <img src="figures/content.PNG" height="350" width="800" alt=""/>
<p>
    The result of the operation is shown in the figure below:
</p>

   <img src="figures/b.PNG" height="210" width="700" alt=""/>
<p>
    We can see from the running results that after setting the break point,
    the program stops when it reaches the <samp>print</samp> function.
    Then, execute the command <samp>c</samp> to let the program continue,
    and then the program continues to execute.
</p>
<h3>2. Peeking registers:</h3>
<pre>
    regs
</pre>
<p>This command can get the current register status of the process.
    The execution result of the command is shown in the figure below:</p>

<img src="figures/regs.PNG" height="180" width="200" alt=""/>

<h3>3. Peeking memory:</h3>
<pre>
    x/x 0xaddr
</pre>
<p>
    The function of the command <samp>x/x 0xaddr</samp> is to display the contents of
    the executable file in hexadecimal.  The execution result of the command is shown
    in the figure below:
</p>

<img src="figures/xx.PNG" height="200" width="280" alt=""/>
<img src="figures/content1.PNG" height="350" width="500" alt=""/>


<pre>
    x/i 0xaddr
</pre>
<p>
    The function of this command is to disassemble the executable file and output the assembly code.
    The execution result of the command is shown
    in the figure below:
</p>

<img src="figures/xi.PNG" height="300" width="300" alt=""/>
<img src="figures/content1.PNG" height="350" width="500" alt=""/>

<p>
    There are several other commands implemented in the source code we provide,
    you need to read the code and understand the implementation principle.
</p>

<h2>Part B: Principle</h2>

<p>
    Have you ever wondered how a program like the GNU debugger helps you peek into the working of
    another program? Have you thought of the magic which goes into a fascinating environment
    like UML (User Mode Linux)? It's the magic of `ptrace', one of the most interesting system calls
    available on GNU/Linux. The objective of this article is to present the systems programmer with
    sufficient information on the working of `ptrace' using which she can do cool projects like the
    design of a simple debugger on her own.
</p>
<h3>
    Getting started
</h3>
<p>
    When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes a <i>system call</i>, one of the calls in
    the operating systemâ€™s interface. The system call enters the kernel; the kernel performs the service
    and returns. Thus, a process alternates between executing in <i>user space</i> and <i>kernel space</i>.
</p>

<p>
    The `ptrace' system call helps us temporarily stop a running process and read as well as modify the
    contents of registers and memory locations used by it. The traced program can be made to stop every
    time it tries to enter the kernel via a system call and every time it comes out of a syscall.
    We can also make the traced program stop itself after the execution of a single instruction.
    These features are enough to design debugging programs as well as
    sophisticated `virtualization' facilities like User Mode Linux.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with the code segment shown below:
</p>

<pre>
    #include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
    main()
    {
        ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);
        while(1);
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Try pressing `Ctrl-C' while the program is running. You will note that instead of getting
    terminated (which is the usual behaviour), the program gets `stopped'; executing `ps ax'
    shows that this is indeed the case.
</p>

<p>
    The `ptrace' system call has the prototype:
</p>
<pre>
    long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);
</pre>

<p>
    The first argument is a `request'. Here, we are using the macro PTRACE_TRACEME by which
    our program is conveying its readiness to get `traced'. The remaining three arguments
    are simply ignored if the request is PTRACE_TRACEME. Once the program has announced
    that it is ready to be traced, any signal delivered to it (with the exception of SIGKILL)
    will result in the process getting stopped. Pressing `Ctrl-C' results in a SIGINT signal
    being delivered to the process..
</p>

<h3>
    Letting a parent trace its child
</h3>
<p>
    Let's make things a bit more interesting.
</p>

<pre>
    /* `tracer' parent */
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
#include &ltsignal.h>
#include &ltsys/types.h>
#include &ltsys/wait.h>
main()
{
    int pid, status;
    if((pid = fork()) == 0) {
        execl("/home2/lfy/child1", "child1", 0);
        printf("exec failed...\n");
    } else {
        sleep(1);
        kill(pid, SIGINT);
        wait(&status); // wait for child to stop
        if(WIFSTOPPED(status))
            printf("child has stopped...\n");
        sleep(3);
        ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
        /* Will not come out of this wait because
         * child does not terminate.
         */
        wait(&status);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The code above shows a program which calls the `fork' system call and creates a copy of itself.
    The child process invokes `execl' and runs the program `child1' which has been compiled from:
</p>

<pre>
    /* compile this program to `child1' */
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
main()
{
    ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);
    while(1) printf("hello\n");
}
</pre>


<p>
    The program being exec'd keeps printing `hello' in an infinite loop after expressing its willingness
    to be traced. Now, the parent process sleeps for 1 second and then sends the SIGINT signal to the
    child (using the `kill' system call). As a result, the child process stops and the parent comes
    out of `wait'; the WIFSTOPPED macro checks whether the variable `status' contains a bit pattern
    which indicates the fact that the child has stopped. The parent then goes to sleep for three more
    seconds; once it comes out of the sleep, it restarts the child by invoking `ptrace' with the
    request PTRACE_CONT.
</p>

<p>
    The basic usage of `ptrace' can be summed up as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Parent process forks and execs the child; the child
        should express its willingness to be traced.
    <li> Parent sends a signal to the child and waits for the
        child to stop.
    <li> Once the child stops, the parent can manipulate it in
        different ways by invoking `ptrace' with several different
        `requests'.
    <li> When the parent has completed all `manipulations',
        it can restart the child and let it run to completion
        (or maybe arrange things in such a way that the child automatically
        stops at the next entry to a system call or stops after
        doing just one instruction).
</ul>
<p>
    Note that in this example, if the parent is to be able to trace the child,
    the child should have called `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...)'.
    If we are planning to write a debugger, we should be able to trace arbitrary processes
    and not just those who have expressed their willingness to be traced.
</p>
<pre>
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
#include &ltsignal.h>
#include &ltsys/types.h>
#include &ltsys/wait.h>
main()
{
    int pid, status;
    if((pid = fork()) == 0) {
        ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);
        execl("/home2/lfy/child2", "child2", 0);
        printf("exec failed...\n");
    } else {
        wait(&status);
        if(WIFSTOPPED(status))
            printf("child has stopped...\n");
        sleep(10);
        ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
        wait(&status);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The code above shows a parent process which forks a child - the child immediately invokes the
    PTRACE_TRACEME request before loading `child2' (compiled from code below).
</p>

<pre>
    //compile into `child2'
main()
{
    /* Note that we are not calling ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,...)
     * here. That will be done by the process which has
     * exec'd this one.
     */
    printf("child starts...\n");
    sleep(1);
    while(1) printf("hello\n");
}
</pre>
<p>
    The `ptrace' manual page says that an invocation of PTRACE_TRACEME will
    result in a signal SIGTRAP being delivered to the process every time an `exec' is called,
    even before the exec'd process gets a chance to run. As a result of getting this signal,
    the process stops. The parent then comes out of the wait, sleeps for ten seconds and
    restarts the exec'd process with an invocation of PTRACE_CONT.
</p>
<h3> Parent peeks into child's registers!</h3>

<pre>
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
#include &ltsignal.h>
#include &ltlinux/user.h>
#include &ltsys/types.h>
#include &ltsys/wait.h>
main()
{

    int i = 0, status = 0, pid;
    struct user_regs_struct uregs;

    if ((pid=fork())==0) {
        ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);
        execl("/home2/lfy/child3", "child3", 0);
        printf("execl error...\n");
    } else {
        wait(&status);
        ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
        sleep(1);
        //child should have got into the loop by
        //this time!
        kill(pid, SIGINT);
        wait(&status);
        ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
        printf("rbx = %d\n", uregs.rbx);
        uregs.rbx = 245;
        ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
        ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
        wait(&status);
        printf("parent: out of wait: %d...\n", WIFSTOPPED(status));
        sleep(100);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above shows a parent which stops a child process, `child3', retrieves
    the values of all the CPU registers used by the child, alters the value of the `rbx'
    register and then let's the child continue its execution.
    The PTRACE_GETREGS request results in the values of the CPU registers used
    by the stopped child getting copied to a variable `uregs' of type `user_regs_struct'.
</p>
<p>
    If you read the code below:
</p>
<pre>
/* Compile this program into `child3' */
main()
{
    printf("child3 starts...\n");
    asm("pushl %rbx\n\t"
        "movl  $143, %rbx\n\t"
        "L1: cmpl $245, %rbx\n\t"
        "jne L1\n\t"
        "popl %rbx\n\t");
    printf("child3 outside loop...\n");
}
</pre>
<p>
    you will see that the `rbx' register has the value 143 and the child keeps on looping
    until it becomes equal to 245. The parent simply displays the value of the `rbx' register
    (stored in the field uregs.rbx) and changes it to 245 by invoking PTRACE_SETREGS.
    The child is then restarted; it comes out of the loop because `rbx' has become 245.
</p>
<h3>
    Parent peeks into child's memory!
</h3>
<p>
    A tracing process can peek into the traced process's address space and extract
    the values of variables stored there. Say you wish to stop a process, examine the value
    of a variable `i' and change it to some other value. A fundamental problem is
    identifying the address of the variable. A trivial solution would be to make the
    process itself print it out or use an object file analysis tool like `nm'.
    A better way is to use the GNU BFD library.
</p>
<pre>
/* Compile this program into `child4' */
int i = 143;
main()
{
    printf("child4 starts...\n");
    while(i != 245);
    printf("child4 outside loop...\n");
}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above shows a program which keeps on
    looping till a global variable `i' becomes equal to 245.
    Here is part of the output I got when I compiled the code into `child4':
</p>
<div>
    <kbd>
        $ gcc -static child4.c -o child4
    </kbd>
</div>
and executed
<pre>nm ./child4</pre>

<pre>

</pre>
<p>
    We see that the variable `i' has been assigned the address 0x00000000004ba0f0.
    This address can be used by the code segment shown below to examine the value of `i' and alter it.
    The PTRACE_PEEKDATA parameter should be followed by the pid of the process being traced and
    the address of the location whose contents we wish to examine; in this case, it should be
    the address which `nm' has displayed. The PTRACE_POKEDATA request can be used to alter the
    contents of a memory location.
</p>
<pre >
//segment of code which alters value of
//a variable in a child process. Identical
//to code which reads and changes register value.

//`addr' is address of variable being accessed.
data = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, pid, addr, 0);
printf("data = %d\n", data);
data = 245;
ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, pid, addr, data);
ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
wait(&status);


</pre>
<h3>
    Single Stepping
</h3>
<p>
    Debuggers help us `single-step' through our code, ie, execute one instruction,
    then stop and view value of some variable, execute one more instruction and so on.
    It's easy to do this using the PTRACE_SINGLESTEP request which restarts the stopped process,
    lets it execute a single instruction and then stops it once again.
</p>
<pre>
//wait for child to stop at the `exec'
wait(&status);
while(1) {
     // do just one instruction
     ptrace(PTRACE_SINGLESTEP, pid, 0, 0);
     wait(&status);
     if(WIFEXITED(status)) break;
     // `addr' is address of `i' in child process
     dat = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKDATA, pid, addr, 0);
     if(dat == 10) {
           ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, pid, addr, 2341);
           ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
           break;
      }
}
wait(&status);
if(WIFEXITED(status))printf("child over\n");
</pre>
<p>
    The code above  shows a segment of a tracing process which keeps on calling
    PTRACE_SINGLESTEP until value of a variable (at location `addr') in the
    traced program is found to become equal to 10. At this stage, the tracing program
    changes the value to 2341 and lets the traced program run to completion by invoking PTRACE_CONT.
</p>
<pre>
//compile into `child5'
int i;
main()
{
    i = 10;
    printf("child: i = %d\n", i);
}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above shows the program being traced.
</p>
<h3>
    System call tracing
</h3>
<p>
    The Linux implementation of `ptrace' has the ability to trace system calls.
    The PTRACE_SYSCALL request restarts the child process (just like PTRACE_CONT)
    but arranges for it to stop at the next entry to or exit from a system call.
    This opens up some interesting possibilities.
</p>

<pre>
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
#include &ltsignal.h>
#include &ltlinux/user.h>
#include &ltsys/types.h>
#include &ltsys/wait.h>
main()
{

    int  status = 0, pid, r;
    struct user_regs_struct uregs;
    if ((pid=fork())==0) {
        printf("pid = %d, ppid = %d\n", getpid(), getppid());
        ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0);
        kill(getpid(), SIGINT);
        r = getpid();
        printf("%d\n", r);
    } else {
        wait(&status);
        ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, pid, 0, 0);
        wait(&status);
        ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
        //this should print 20, syscall number of getpid
        printf("syscall nr: %d\n", uregs.orig_eax);
        // 64 is syscall number of getppid
        uregs.orig_eax = 64;
        ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
        ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
        wait(&status);
        if(WIFEXITED(status))printf("child over\n");
        sleep(1000);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above  shows a child process which first prints its own process id
    as well as its parent process id and then delivers a signal to itself.
    Because it is ready to be traced, this will result in the process getting stopped.
    The parent waits for this to happen and restarts the child by invoking PTRACE_SYSCALL.
    The next instruction in the child is an invocation of the `getpid' system call;
    the child gets stopped once again. Each system call has a unique `call number'
    - the operating system kernel uses this to identify the actual function to be executed.
    The parent process extracts this call number by invoking PTRACE_GETREGS
    (the `orig_eax' field of `ureg' holds the call number) and changes it to the
    call number of `getppid' by invoking PTRACE_SETREGS. The child is then restarted and allowed
    to run to completion by invoking PTRACE_CONT. Because the call number has been changed,
    the child will execute `getppid' instead of `getpid'!
</p>
<p>
    This system call `redirection' has significance in the context of User Mode Linux (UML),
    which is a port of the Linux kernel to itself. UML allows you to run a modified version
    of the Linux kernel on top of the actual Linux kernel! You can run processes under the
    control of the modified kernel. When these processes execute system calls, they should
    execute code present in the modified kernel and not the original host kernel. This is
    achieved by using the PTRACE_SYSCALL facility offered by UML; interested readers should
    check out some of the papers available on the net which describe UML architecture.
</p>
<h3>
    System call tracing

<p>
    The Linux implementation of `ptrace' has the ability to trace system calls. The PTRACE_SYSCALL
    request restarts the child process (just like PTRACE_CONT) but arranges for it to stop at the

<p>
    The code above  shows a child process which first prints its own process id
    as well as its parent process id and then delivers a signal to itself.
    Because it is ready to be traced, this will result in the process getting stopped.
    The parent waits for this to happen and restarts the child by invoking PTRACE_SYSCALL.
    The next instruction in the child is an invocation of the `getpid' system call;
    the child gets stopped once again. Each system call has a unique `call number'
    - the operating system kernel uses this to identify the actual function to be executed.
    The parent process extracts this call number by invoking PTRACE_GETREGS (the `orig_rax'
    field of `ureg' holds the call number) and changes it to the call number of `getppid'
    by invoking PTRACE_SETREGS. The child is then restarted and allowed to run to completion
    by invoking PTRACE_CONT. Because the call number has been changed, the child will
    execute `getppid' instead of `getpid'!
</p>
<p>
    This system call `redirection' has significance in the context of User Mode Linux (UML),
    which is a port of the Linux kernel to itself. UML allows you to run a modified version
    of the Linux kernel on top of the actual Linux kernel! You can run processes under the
    control of the modified kernel. When these processes execute system calls, they should
    execute code present in the modified kernel and not the original host kernel. This is
    achieved by using the PTRACE_SYSCALL facility offered by UML; interested readers should
    check out some of the papers available on the net which describe UML architecture.

<h3>
    Using the BFD library
</h3>
<p>
    The GNU BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library can be used to extract information from binary files.
    At the moment, we are only interested in scanning an object file and identifying the names
    and addresses of all the globally visible symbols.
</p>
<pre>
    // compile: cc filename.c -lbfd -liberty
// Type `info bfd' on your GNU/Linux system to
// read more about the BFD library.
#include &ltbfd.h>
#include &ltstdlib.h>
#include &ltassert.h>
#include &ltstdio.h>

//argv[1] should be name of an object file
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    long storage_needed, num_symbols, i;
    asymbol **symbol_table;
    bfd *abfd;
    char filename[100];

    bfd_init(); // magic

    abfd = bfd_openr(argv[1], NULL);
    assert(abfd != NULL);
    bfd_check_format(abfd, bfd_object);
    storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound(abfd);
    assert(storage_needed >= 0);
    printf("storage = %d\n", storage_needed);

    symbol_table = (asymbol**)malloc(storage_needed);
    assert(symbol_table != 0);
    num_symbols = bfd_canonicalize_symtab(abfd, symbol_table);
    assert(num_symbols >= 0);
    printf("num syms = %d\n", num_symbols);
    for(i = 0; i < num_symbols; i++)
        printf("%s: %x\n", bfd_asymbol_name(symbol_table[i]),
            bfd_asymbol_value(symbol_table[i]));

}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above is a program which does exactly this. It can be easily
    altered to yield the addresses of only those symbols we are interested in.
</p>
<p>
    Each element of the array `symbol_table' contains a pointer to an object of
    type `asymbol'. The macro's `bfd_asymbol_name' and `bfd_asymbol_value' are used
    to extract the name of the symbol as well as its address.
</p>
<h3>
    Attaching to a running process
</h3>
<p>
    All the examples we had seen till now involved a parent process spawning
    a child and then tracing it. It is possible to use `ptrace' to trace an already
    running process which is not a proper child of the tracing program.
</p>
<pre>
#include &ltsys/ptrace.h>
#include &ltsignal.h>
#include &ltlinux/user.h>
#include &ltsys/types.h>
#include &ltsys/wait.h>
main()
{

    int  status = 0, pid, addr;
    struct user_regs_struct uregs;

    scanf("%x%d", &addr, &pid);
    ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0);
    wait(&status);
    ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
    printf("eip: %x\n", uregs.eip);
    uregs.eip = addr;
    ptrace(PTRACE_SETREGS, pid, 0, &uregs);
    ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0, 0);
    wait(&status);
    if(WIFEXITED(status))printf("child over\n");
    sleep(1000);
}
</pre>
<p>
    The code above shows a tracing program calling PTRACE_ATTACH on a running
    process whose pid has been read from the keyboard.
</p>
<pre>
fun()
{
    while(1) printf("hello\n");
}

main()
{
    while(1);
}
</pre>
<p>
    shows the code of the process being traced. The tracing program has another input
    - the address of the function `fun' in the process being attached to.
    The effect of calling PTRACE_ATTACH is that the target becomes a `traced child' of
    the calling process; also, it appears as if the task being traced has called a PTRACE_TRACEME.
    A signal, SIGSTOP is delivered to it (as part of the PTRACE_ATTACH invocation)
    - the tracing program can now `wait' for the `child' to stop. Once the parent comes out of
    the wait, it examines the value of the instruction pointer in the child (the value stored in uregs.rip)
    and alters it to point to the function `fun'. The process is then restarted
    (note that there will be trouble if the function returns as we haven't stored
    a proper return address on the stack).
</p>

<h2>Part C: Implementation</h2>
<p>
    First, download the <a href="ssedb.c">source file</a> of
    <code>ssedb</code>
    to your machine, along with a trivial testing program:
</p>

<pre>
    #include&ltstdio.h>
    void print(){
        printf("hi\n");
    }
    int main(){
        printf("hello\n");
        print();
        return 0;
    }
</pre>

    Compile the testing program files:
<pre>css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>gcc -o hello.out hello.c</kbd>
</pre>
And then run the debugger on <samp>hello.out</samp>:


<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>:
    Read the source file and answer: how the
    <samp>regs</samp> command is implemented?
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: How the breaking point command
    <samp>b 0xaddr</samp> is implemented?
    In fact, there is a serious bug in current
    implementation we offered you.
    Let's check where is this bug. First run this
    <pre>css-lab@tiger:~$ <kbd>objdump -d hello.out</kbd></pre>
    and figure out the address of the function <samp>print</samp>, suppose that
        address is <samp>0xaddr</samp> on your machine. Now in the <samp>ssedb</samp>, you set up
        a break point on address <samp>0xaddr</samp> by typing (remember this address must be in hexadecimal,
        which has a leading <samp>0x</samp>):
    <pre>(ssedb) <kbd>b 0xaddr</kbd></pre>
        now peek the registers:
    <pre>(ssedb) <kbd>regs</kbd></pre>
    What's the value of <samp>rip</samp>? Is this value right? Why?
   And then disassembly the content at address <samp>0xaddr</samp>.
    <pre>(ssedb) <kbd>x/x 0xaddr</kbd></pre>
    What's there? Have you detected the bug? How to fix this bug?
</div>
<div class="question">
    <i>Exercise 3:</i>
    There is also a command to disassembly binary into assembly
    instructions, which has not been implemented. Now run
    <pre>(ssedb) <kbd>x/i 0xaddr</kbd></pre>
        you'll see an error message indicating the file position you should supply code.
        Implement it. (Hint: manual disassemblying is tedious and error-prone,
        so you may find some libraries are helpful, such as the
        <a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">zydis</a>.)
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i>
        Another feature missing from the <samp>ssedb</samp> is debugging symbols. For instance,
        when setting up breaking points, we'd like just to type a symbolic name, such as:
    <pre>(ssedb) <kbd>b main</kbd></pre>
        instead of an ugly hexadecimal address for <samp>main</samp>.
    Implement this feature.
