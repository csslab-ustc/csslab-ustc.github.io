<h1>Lab 1: Control-flow Graphs</h1>

<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this course, you will implement a series of classical program analyses 
    and optimizations on compiler intermediate representations (IRs) 
    using the provided Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Control Flow Graph 
    (CFG) data structures.
    You will use Java as the implementation language.
    By the end of this course, you will not only learn
    the theory and practice of compilers, but also gain a deeper
    understanding about Java.
</p>
<p>
    There are 6 labs planned:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lab 1: Control-flow Graphs.
        You will design a translator to transfer AST to CFG, and implement 
        several CFG operations and optimizations.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 2: Data-flow Analysis.
        You will design and implement several classic data-flow analysis
        (e.g. liveness analysis) based on CFG.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 3: Lattice.
        You will refactor the data-flow analysis in Lab 2 
        using the lattice-based monotonic framework. 
    </li>
    <li>Lab 4: Static Single-assignment Form.
        You will design and implement a static single-assignment form,
        and perform compiler optimizations on it.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 5: Interprocedural.
        You will design and implement several classic interprocedural 
        analyses and optimizations.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 6: Pointer.
        You will design and implement a pointer analysis.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is the lab 1. In this lab, you will design a translator to transfer 
    AST to CFG, and implement several CFG operations and optimizations.
</p>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>
    In this lab, you will use Java as your implementation language,
    please first check
    <a href="../../references.html" target="_blank">the reference page</a>
    to install necessary software, if you have not installed the
    Java platform.
    Make sure to install the latest
    Java compiler and runtime (<em>version 24</em>), other versions
    of Java do NOT work as the Dragon compiler makes use of some
    latest Java feature in version 24 (e.g., pattern matching or
    string templates).
    You can use any Java IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, or VS code).
</p>

<h3>Version control and Git</h3>
<p>
    In each lab, we will supply skeleton code for you to start with
    and modify. These files are controlled and distributed using the Git
    version control system. So, to access these files, you will first
    need a Git client installed on your machine. On Linux or Mac, it is
    easy to install a Git client:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linux:
        <pre>$ <kbd>sudo apt install git</kbd></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Mac:
        <pre>$ <kbd>brew install git</kbd></pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    On Windows, there are many
    Git clients available, among which
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">msysgit</a>
    is a very popular one, you can
    install and try it if you are using Windows.
</p>
<p>
    For those who have no prior experience of using Git, do not
    forget to refer to the
    <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">official manual</a>
    when in doubt.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    This year, we have put the skeleton code repository on
    GitHub (hence this courseware is open-source).
    To check out the code repository for lab 1 to your machine, you should
    run the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/csslab-ustc/dragon.git</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will create a new folder <code>dragon</code> in
    which reside all the source files just checked out for the
    <em>lab 1</em> branch (the default branch).
</p>
<p>
    Git is a distributed version control system, allowing one to work with
    the local version of repository on your machine. For
    instance, if you have finished the exercise 5 in lab 1,
    you can commit your changes by:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab 1, exercise 5'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will commit the changes to your <em>local</em> repository.
</p>
<p>
    Now import the project into your favorite Java IDE and browse the
    source code:
</p>
<pre>
    src/ast/*:              the data structures of Abstract Syntax Tree
    src/cfg/*:              the data structures of Control-flow Graph
    src/frontend/*:         the lexer and parser
    src/control/*:          to control the behavior of the compiler
    src/main/Dragon.java:   the "Main" class serving as compiler entry
    src/util/*:             utility classes
    test/*:                 C programs as testcases (so do not compile them as compiler sources)
</pre>
<p>
    Now, build this project on your machine. When the
    building process finished, a new <code>bin</code> folder
    would be created. Note that the name of the output folder
    depends on your specific IDE configurations.
    For example, the folder may be named <code>out</code> or
    something else. But we will always name it <code>bin</code>
    in the following and subsequent labs.
</p>
<!-- <p>
    If there are no building errors during the building process,
    you can run the <code>Dragon</code> compiler:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Dragon -help</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will output something like:
</p>
<pre class="output">

Available options:
    -dump {token}   dump tokens from lexical analysis
    -help           show this help information
</pre> -->

<!-- part A -->
<h2>Part A: Translate into CFG</h2>
<p>
    In a compiler, source files undergo two processing steps: lexical analysis 
    and syntax analysis, to be converted into an intermediate representation 
    called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The compiler then performs semantic analysis 
    on AST to check for program semantic errors. If the AST passes semantic 
    analysis, the compiler considers the program valid and proceeds to optimization 
    phases. However, AST is generally not ideal data structures for program 
    optimization. To facilitate subsequent optimizations, the compiler converts 
    the AST into another intermediate representation called Control Flow Graph 
    (CFG) that better suits optimization needs.
</p>
<p>
    In our Dragon MiniC compiler, we have already implemented the lexical analysis, 
    syntax analysis, and semantic analysis (located in <code>src/frontend</code>) 
    for you, and translated the source code into AST. 
    In this part of the lab, you will do some programming exercises to translate
    AST into CFG. Don't worry, we've prepared most of the code for you.
    You can study the existing codes and fill in the missing parts.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the class definitions of AST and CFG in files
    <code>src/ast/Ast.java</code> and <code>src/cfg/Cfg.java</code>, 
    make sure you understand them and how they are created and used. 
    As a concrete example, you can see file <code>src/ast/SamplePrograms.java</code>
    to see how AST is used. You do not need to write any code for this exercise.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Understand the code in file <code>src/cfg/lab1/Translate.java</code>, fill in the 
    missing parts, and make sure you can translate all AST classes to their
    corresponding CFG classes. Do not forget to test your code when finished, 
    and fix any bugs before continuing.
</div>

<p>
    Once we have CFG, many awsome optimization operations can be applied on it to 
    improve program efficiency. For example, we can reduce code size by removing 
    unreachable code that will never execute. But, before diving into more 
    advanced topics, let's first learn how to use CFG with a simple exercise.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    As a simple exercise of CFG, you can write a class to count total
    instructions in the program. Finish the class
    <code>CFGInstrCounter</code> in file <code>src/cfg/lab1/CFGInstrCounter.java</code>,
    print the number of instructions for each functions, and basic blocks.
    For example, for CFG
    <pre class="output">
    int add(int a, int b) {
        int %x_1;
        L_1:
            %x_1 = +(a, b, );
            ret %x_1;
    }</pre>
    the output looks like
    <pre class="output">
    Function add:
        - Basic block L_1: 2
        - Total: 2
    Total instructions in program: 2</pre>
</div>

<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: CFG Operations</h2>
<p>
    In the process of analyzing and optimizing control flow graphs, 
    compilers need to perform various operations and transformations on them. 
    Since the structure of a control flow graph is inherently a directed graph, 
    all operations applicable to directed graphs can be applied to control flow 
    graphs. 
    In this part, you need to implement several CFG operation algorithms.
</p>

<h3>
    Depth-first Traversal
</h3>
<p>
    Depth-first traversal is a crucial graph algorithm and one of the 
    fundamental algorithms for control flow graph operations.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Understand the code in file <code>src/util/Graph.java</code>, 
    complete the method <code>dfsDoit()</code>.
    You should use method <code>testDFS()</code> in file 
    <code>src/util/UtilTest.java</code> to test your code. 
    Fix any bugs before continuing.
</div>

<h3>
    Node Sorting
</h3>

<p>
    The analysis algorithms for control flow graphs (e.g., data flow analysis) 
    often require traversing nodes of directed graphs in specific orders. 
    To explicitly specify the desired traversal order, linear ordering of nodes 
    in the control flow graph is typically necessary.
    To represent the sequential execution order of nodes, we typically employ 
    topological sorting. 
    However, traditional topological sorting algorithms can only handle 
    directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and fail to process control flow graphs with 
    cyclic structures. Thus, a pseudo-topological sorting must be implemented 
    based on the concept of depth-first traversal.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Complete the method <code>topoSortDoit()</code> in file 
    <code>src/util/Graph.java</code>.
    You should use method <code>testTopoSort()</code> in file 
    <code>src/util/UtilTest.java</code> to test your code. 
    Fix any bugs before continuing.
</div>

<h3>
    Graph Visualization
</h3>

<p>
    It will be nice to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_visualization">
        visualize a control-flow graph</a>,
    making subsequent graph analysis more intuitive.
    Nevertheless, to draw a figure prettily
    is a nontrivial task and may require too much programming
    effort, especially for large and complex graphs.
    Fortunately, there are many off-the-shelf graph drawing
    utilities, so that we do not need
    to reinvent the wheels.
    Specifically, your Dragon compiler will make use
    of the <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
    a very popular graph visualization software, to
    visualize the control-flow graphs generated by
    your Dragon compiler.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Download
    <a href="https://graphviz.org/Download.php">graphviz</a>
    and install it
    on your machine. Do not forget to add it to your PATH.
    To make sure you have installed graphviz correctly, you can
    run the following command on your prompt:
    <pre>$ <kbd>dot --help</kbd></pre>
    <pre class="output">Usage: dot [-Vv?] [-(GNE)name=val] [-(KTlso)&lt;val>] &lt;dot files&gt;
(additional options for neato)    [-x] [-n&lt;v&gt;]
(additional options for fdp)      [-L(gO)] [-L(nUCT)&lt;val&gt;]
(additional options for config)  [-cv]
...</pre>
    Also, you can take a look at
    <a href="https://graphviz.org/Documentation.php">its manual</a>,
    if you are interested in.
</div>

<h3>
    Critical Edge Split
</h3>

<p>
    In a control flow graph, the edge &lt;a, b&gt; is a critical edge if its 
    predecessor node a has multiple successors and its successor node b has 
    multiple predecessors.
    Critical edges in the control flow graph may cause errors in certain 
    operations, therefore, they should be split before performing the operations.
    The following <b>Exercise 7</b> require the use of 
    <a href="https://graphviz.org/Download.php">Graphviz</a>, so make sure to 
    complete <b>Exercise 6</b>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    Complete the method <code>findCriticalEdges()</code> and 
    <code>splitEdge()</code> in file <code>src/util/Graph.java</code>.
    Think carefully how to handle the parameters <code>dataSupplier</code> and 
    <code>dataConnector</code>. 
    You should use method <code>testCriticalEdgeSplit()</code> in file 
    <code>src/util/UtilTest.java</code> to test your code before continuing.
    Once the test is passed, you will obtain a file <code>test-graph.dot</code> 
    and a graph <code>test-graph.dot.png</code>, check them.
</div>

<h2>Part C: Optimizations</h2>
<p>
    This part explores essential compiler optimization techniques 
    to improve program performance. 
    You will implement local value numbering, which eliminates 
    redundant computations by identifying and reusing equivalent 
    expressions, and function inlining, which replaces function 
    calls with their actual body to reduce call overhead and enable 
    further optimizations.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    Read the code in <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>, make sure you understand
    the Java code defining CFG data structures we offered you.
    Then finish the code in <code>cfg/lab1/ValueNumber.java</code>, 
    to eliminate redundant computations. 
    Your task is to identify and replace equivalent expressions within a basic block. 
    Do not forget to test your code when finished, and fix any bugs before continuing. 
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
    Suppose we inline a callee function into its caller 
    only when the following conditions are met:
    <ul>
        <li>The callee function is called fewer 
            than 5 times in the entire program;</li>
        <li>The callee function is a leaf function 
            (i.e., it does not call any other functions);</li>
        <li>The callee function has a code size smaller than 10.</li>
    </ul>
    Finish the code in <code>cfg/lab1/Inline.java</code>, 
    to reduce function call overhead and improve performance. 
    Do not forget to test your code when finished, 
    and fix any bugs before continuing.
