<h1>Lab 3: Optimization</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and implement several classical control 
    flow graph optimization algorithms based on the program analysis algorithm 
    completed in lab 2.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of three parts.
    In part A, you will design and implement a dead code elimination optimization.
    In part B, you will design and implement a constant propagation optimization, 
    and a copy propagation optimization (if you are interested in it).
    Finally, in part C, your will design and implement a common 
    sub-expression elimination optimization.
</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source we offered you for lab 3:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab2'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab3 origin/lab3</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will commit your changes to 'lab2' branch
    to your local Git repository, and create and check out a new lab3
    branch from the remote lab2 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab2 into the
    new lab3 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab2</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commiting to
    the local lab3 branch:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab3 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Lab 3 contains the following new source files,
    which you should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    cfg/lab2/AvailExp.java              available expression analysis framework
    cfg/lab3/ConstPropagation.java      const propagation optimization framework
    cfg/lab3/CopyProp.java              copy propagation optimization framework
    cfg/lab3/DeadCode.java              dead code elimination framework
    cfg/lab3/UnreachableBlock.java      unreachable block elimination framework
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished this lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.

<hr/>
<h1>Part A: Dead Code Elimination</h1>
<p>
    Dead code elimination is an optimization that removes code 
    which does not affect the program’s observable behavior. 
    This includes both <em>useless code</em> (assignments to 
    variables that are never used), and <em>unreachable code</em> 
    (blocks of code that are never executed).  
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    An assignment statement <code>x = v</code> is useless,
    if the variable <code>x</code> does not live out this
    statement. Hence, this statement can be safely
    removed.
    Finish the useless code elimination in
    <code>cfg/lab3/DeadCode.java</code> by implementing the
    aforementioned algorithm. You may assume that side-effecting 
    operations (e.g., method calls, I/O) must be preserved. 
    Also note that removing one useless code may
    have cascading effects to make
    other code dead, so make sure that your useless code elimination
    optimization can eliminate <em>all</em> useless code.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Unreachable code elimination removes basic blocks that 
    cannot be reached from the function’s entry block. 
    Finish the unreachable code elimination in
    <code>cfg/lab3/UnreachableBlock.java</code>. 
</div>

<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h1>Part B: Constant Propagation</h1>
<p>
    Constant propagation propagates a constant definition
    to it uses. For example, for any statement <code>s</code>
    of the form <code>x = y op z</code>, where the variable
    <code>y</code> is defined in
    by a statement t like <code>y = c</code> where <code>c</code>
    is a constant. And
    suppose the definition t is the unique definition that reaches
    the statement s. Then we can replace, in
    the statement s, the variable <code>y</code> by
    the constant <code>c</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Finish the constant propagation code in the file
    <code>cfg/lab3/ConstPropagation.java</code>. 
    To be noted, this exercise relies on Exercise 2, 
    therefore, make sure Exercise 2 has been completed 
    before proceeding with it.
</div>

<p>
    Copy propagation is like constant propagation.
    Suppose, for any statement <code>s</code> of the form <code>x = y</code>
    or <code>x = y op z</code>, where <code>y</code> is defined in
    some statement t like <code>y = m</code> with a variable <code>m</code>. And
    suppose the definition t is the unique definition that reaches
    the statement s. Then you can replace the variable <code>y</code>, in
    the statement s, with the variable <code>m</code> from the statement t.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    Since copy propagation is far more complex than constant propagation, 
    this experiment is presented as a challenge. If you are interested in it, 
    you can try to finish the constant propagation code in the file
    <code>cfg/lab3/CopyProp.java</code>.
</div>

<!-- part C -->
<hr/>
<h1>Part C: Common Sub-Expression Elimination</h1>

In this part, you'll complete the common sub-expression elimination (CSE)
algorithm. You first need to compute the available expression at the entry point
for each statement in the CFG, and use the result to do common sub-expression 
elimination.

<h3>Available Expressions</h3>
<p>
    Consider the statement <code>x = y op z</code>, if the expression
    <code>y op z</code> has been computed before this statement, then
    the expression <code>y op z</code> can reuse the computed result.
    Hence, you can compute whether the expression <code>y op z</code>
    is available here.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Finish the available expression analysis in the file
    <code>cfg/lab2/AvailExp.java</code> if you haven't done it yet.
</div>

<h3>Common Sub-Expression Elimination (CSE)</h3>
<p>
    For the statement <code>x = y op z</code>, if the expression
    <code>y op z</code> is available. We can substitute the
    expression <code>y op z</code> with the most recent definition
    using <code>y op z</code>.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Implement common sub-expression elimination in <code>cfg/lab3/Cse.java</code>.
