<h1>Lab 3: Intermediate Representation</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and implement intermediate
    representations for your <code>Tiger</code> compiler, and lower
    down MiniJava programs by translating
    the abstract syntax trees to the intermediate representation
    you designed.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of four parts.
    In part A, you
    will design and implement a specific intermediate representation:
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph">control-flow graph</a>
    (CFG).
    In part B, you will eliminate the object-oriented features
    in MiniJava by using a prefixing algorithm.
    In part C, you will implement a translator to lower
    down the abstract syntax tree to the control-flow graph.
    Finally, in part D, your will design and implement several
    classical program analysis and optimizations for CFG.
</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source we offered you for lab 3:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab2'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab3 origin/lab3</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    these commands will first commit your changes to the lab2
    branch of your local Git repository, and then create a
    local lab3 branch and check out the remote lab3 branch
    into the new local lab3 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab2 into the
    new lab3 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab2</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commiting to
    the local lab3 branch:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab3 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You should first import the new Lab3 code into
    your editor, and make sure the code compiles. There
    are a bunch of new files that you
    should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    cfg/*:    control-flow graph data structures and operations
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished this lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.
</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Part A: Control-flow Graph</h1>
<p>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph">
    control-flow graph</a>
    (CFG) is a graph-based program intermediate representation
    with basic blocks as nodes and control
    transfers between blocks as edges.
    A control-flow graph
    is a good intermediate representation as it makes every aspect
    of program control- and data-flow properties explicit thus
    easier to compute.
    As a result, in modern compilers, CFGs serve as not only
    carriers for compiler optimizations, but also backbones
    for more advanced intermediate representations such as
    static single-assignment forms (SSA).
</p>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will first design
    data structures defining the control-flow
    graph.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the code in <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>, make sure you understand
    the Java code defining CFG data structures we offered you.
    Your job is to extend the CFG
    data structure to support all language
    features of MiniJava. You can work iteratively, that is,
    you can continue to the subsequent
    exercises, and go back to extend the CFG data structure when necessary.
</div>
<p>
    To inspect the generated data structure, you might compile the test
    case we provide. For example,
    you can compile the test case <code>test/SumRec.java</code> to
    inspect the generated CFG:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp ./bin Tiger -builtin SumRec.java
    -trace cfg.Translate.doitProgram</kbd></pre>
<p>
    It is often important to measure the sizes of
    the generated CFG, which reflects the memory occupation.
    For example, after you have implemented
    a compiler optimization to shrink the target CFG,
    you can evaluate the effectiveness of your
    optimization by comparing the sizes before and after that
    optimization.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Write a <code>size()</code> method for each syntactic
    category in the file
    <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>, to measure the size of the CFG
    in terms of the numbers of functions,
    basic blocks, and statements. The output might
    consist of a list of triples &lt;methodNam, nBlock, nStms&gt;.
    For example, the following output
    <pre class="output">&lt;#methods, #blocks, #statements>
---------------------------------
<"f1", 5,  300>
<"g",  30, 400>
...
---------------------------------
subtotal 140, 25000</pre>
    specifies the method <code>f1</code> has
    5 basic blocks and 300 statements, whereas the method
    <code>g</code> has 30 basic blocks and 400 statements, and
    so on.
    In a summary, the program has 140 basic blocks
    with 25,000 statements.
</div>

<h3>Graph Visualization</h3>
<p>
    It will be nice to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_visualization">
        visualize a control-flow graph</a>,
    making subsequent graph analysis more intuitive.
    Nevertheless, to draw a figure prettily
    is a nontrivial task and may require too much programming
    effort, especially for large and complex graphs.
    Fortunately, there are many off-the-shelf graph drawing
    utilities, so that we do not need
    to reinvent the wheels.
    Specifically, your Tiger compiler will make use
    of the <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
    a very popular graph visualization software, to
    visualize the control-flow graphs generated by
    your Tiger compiler.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Download
    <a href="https://graphviz.org/Download.php">graphviz</a>
    and install it
    on your machine. Do not forget to add it to your PATH.
    To make sure you have installed graphviz correctly, you can
    run the following command on your prompt:
    <pre>$ <kbd>dot --help</kbd></pre>
    <pre class="output">Usage: dot [-Vv?] [-(GNE)name=val] [-(KTlso)&lt;val>] &lt;dot files&gt;
(additional options for neato)    [-x] [-n&lt;v&gt;]
(additional options for fdp)      [-L(gO)] [-L(nUCT)&lt;val&gt;]
(additional options for config)  [-cv]
...</pre>
    Also, you can take a look at
    <a href="https://graphviz.org/Documentation.php">its manual</a>,
    if you are interested in.
</div>

<p>
    The Tiger compiler has rudimentary support to
    visualize a CFG, that is, it can draw a graph for each
    function in a program, respectively.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Finish the code <code>dot()</code> in the file
    <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>, to visualize
    each function. You can run the test case <code>test/SumRec.java</code>:
    <pre>$ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp ./bin Tiger -builtin SumRec.java -dot cfg</kbd></pre>
    to draw a sample CFG. Your task is to extend the <code>dot()</code>
    to draw statements and transfers in each block besides block labels.
</div>

<p>
    Do not forget to test your Tiger compiler extensively
    before continuing. Especially, make sure your Tiger compiler
    can compile all testcases under the directory <code>./test/</code>.
</p>


<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: Class Elimination</h2>
<p>
    The class elimination pass implements object-oriented features
    in MiniJava by lowering down them to low-level constructs.
    Specifically, this pass finishes three sub-tasks:
    1) it eliminates
    classes by translating them to C-style structures;
    2) it closes each (non-static) method by introducing
    an explicit <code>this</code> as the first parameter; and
    3) it turns each method invocation into a virtual function call.
    In the following, we will discuss the first two steps and leave
    the last step to the next section (part C).
</p>

<h3>The Prefixing Algorithm</h3>
<p>
    The prefixing algorithm builds an inheritance tree,
    and eliminates class inheritance by a level-order
    tree walking.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Finish the method
    <code>buildInheritTree0()</code> to build an inherit
    tree, with each tree node containing a class.
    When finished, you might visualize the tree to test
    your implementation.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Finish the method
    <code>prefixOneClass()</code> to implement the
    prefixing algorithm.
</div>

<p>
    To this, a MiniJava class will be translated into
    two components: a structure (like <code>struct</code> in C),
    a virtual function table holding a list of function pointers to
    all the constituting methods in that class.
    Test your Tiger compiler and fix any bugs before continuing.
</p>

<h3>Closing Method</h3>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    Extend your implementation of the method
    <code>prefixOneClass()</code>, to close each method by introducing
    an extra <code>this</code> argument.
    Pay special attention to its type. For simplicity, you can
    generate an empty CFG function for each AST method serving as
    place-holders to be filled in subsequently.
</div>


<!-- part C -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part C: CFG Generation</h2>
<p>
    The CFG generation phase generates a CFG representation
    for the given abstract syntax tree. The generation makes
    use of a
    recursive-decedent algorithm.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    Finish the methods
    <code>doitMethod()</code>, <code>doitStm()</code>, and
    <code>doitExp()</code>, to translate a given method, statement, and
    expression to its corresponding CFG representation, respectively.
</div>

<p>
    Do not forget to test your Tiger compiler using
    the test cases in <code>test/</code> as well as your own
    ones.
    Fix any bugs before continuing.
</p>

<!-- part D -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part D: CFG-based Program Analysis and Optimizations</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will familiarize yourself
    with program analysis and compiler optimizations by
    writing several classical program
    analysis (e.g., liveness analysis, reaching definitions, available
    expressions), and optimizations (e.g., constant propagation,
    copy propagation, dead code elimination).
</p>

<p>
    You will write most
    data-flow analysis algorithms with the following general
    template:
</p>
<pre class="code">
data_flow_analysis()
    calculate the <em>gen</em> and <em>kill</em> sets for each statement and transfer;
    calculate the <em>in</em> and <em>out</em> sets for each statement and transfer.   // fix-point
</pre>
<p>
    For specific data-flow algorithms you will write next,
    the above template differs in
    1) how <code>gen</code> and <em>kill</em> sets
    are defined, 2) how <code>in</code> and <code>out</code>
    sets are calculated, 3) in what order the iteration
    should be conducted; and 4) when to stop.
    Hence, you will need to
    modify this algorithm template to finish the specific analysis.
</p>
<h3>Liveness Analysis</h3>
<p>
    A
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness_analysis">liveness analysis</a>
    calculates, for each statement
    and transfer in a function, the live-in and live-out variable sets.
    In liveness analysis, you should calculate
    <code>in</code> and <code>live_out</code> for the <code>in</code>
    and <code>out</code> separately; and the fix-point code should
    calculate the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> sets for
    each basic block in a reverse topo-sort order.
    But for other data-flow analysis, these details may be different.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
    Finish the liveness analysis code in the source file
    <code>cfg/Liveness.java</code> by implementing the
    aforementioned algorithm.
</div>

<p>
    A particularly interesting application of liveness
    analysis is to detect uninitialized variables.
    An uninitialized variable is used before assigned a value,
    which always indicate some kind of programming errors.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
    Design and implement an algorithm to detect uninitialized
    variables, by leveraging the results of liveness analysis.
</div>

<h3>Dead-code Elimination</h3>
<p>
    An assignment statement <code>x = v</code> is dead,
    if the variable <code>x</code> does not live out this
    statement. Hence, this statement can be safely
    removed.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
    Finish the dead code elimination in
    <code>cfg/DeadCode.java</code> by implementing the
    aforementioned algorithm. You should avoid the pitfalls
    discussed in the Tiger book by not removing
    <em>live</em> statements. Also note that removing one dead code may
    have cascading effects to make
    other code dead, so make sure that your dead-code elimination
    optimization can eliminate <em>all</em> dead code.
</div>

<h3>Reaching Definitions</h3>
<p>
    Intuitively, a reaching
    definition analyzes which definition can reach a given use.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
    Implement the reaching definition analysis
    <code>cfg/ReachDef.java</code>, as described
    in Table 17.2 of the Tiger book.
    This
    algorithm is similar to the liveness analysis algorithm, except for
    it performs the analysis in a forward manner.
</div>

<h3>Constant Propagation</h3>
<p>
    A constant propagation propagates a constant definition
    to it uses. For example, for any statement <code>s</code>
    of the form <code>x = y op z</code>, where the variable
    <code>y</code> is defined in
    by a statement t like <code>y = c</code> where <code>c</code>
    is a constant. And
    suppose the definition t is the unique definition that reaches
    the statement s. Then we can replace, in
    the statement s, the variable <code>y</code> by
    the constant <code>c</code>.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 13.</span>
    Finish the constant propagation code in the file
    <code>cfg/ConstProp.java</code>. Note that to this point, the
    Tiger compiler will perform all these analysis and optimizations
    in a linear order, however, this is not the desired order
    for optimizations. So, you may want to modify the
    <code>cfg/Optimize.java</code> code to use a
    fancy order.
</div>

<h3>Copy Propagation</h3>
<p>
    Copy propagation is like constant propagation.
    Suppose, for any statement <code>s</code> of the form <code>x = y</code>
    or <code>x = y op z</code>, where <code>y</code> is defined in
    some statement t like <code>y = m</code> with a variable <code>m</code>. And
    suppose the definition t is the unique definition that reaches
    the statement s. Then you can replace the variable <code>y</code>, in
    the statement s, with the variable <code>m</code> from the statement t.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 14.</span>
    Finish the constant propagation code in the file
    <code>cfg/CopyProp.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Available Expressions</h3>
<p>
    Consider the statement <code>x = y op z</code>, if the expression
    <code>y op z</code> has been computed before this statement, then
    the expression <code>y op z</code> can reuse the computed result.
    Hence, you can compute whether the expression <code>y op z</code>
    is available here.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 15.</span>
    Finish the available expression analysis in the file
    <code>cfg/AvailExp.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Common Sub-Expression Elimination (CSE)</h3>
<p>
    For the statement <code>x = y op z</code>, if the expression
    <code>y op z</code> is available. We can substitute the
    expression <code>y op z</code> with the most recent definition
    using <code>y op z</code>. You may refer to the Tiger book
    section 17.3 for this algorithm.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 16.</span>
    Implement common sub-expression elimination in <code>cfg/Cse.java</code>.
</div>
