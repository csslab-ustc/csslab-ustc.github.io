<h1>Lab 4: Lattice</h1>

<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design several lattices and implement two program 
    analysis algorithms based on lattice theory.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of three parts: 
    First, in part A, you will implement three classical lattices 
    (diamond lattice, flat lattice, and powerset lattice).
    Second, in part B, you will implement a zero-value analysis algorithm 
    based on the diamond lattice.
    Finally, in part C, you will restructure the liveness analysis algorithm 
    based on the powerset lattice and implement a monotonic framework 
    (if you are interested in it).
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source we offered you for lab 4:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab3'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab4 origin/lab4</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    these commands will first commit your changes to the lab3
    branch of your local Git repository, and then create a
    local lab4 branch and check out the remote lab4 branch
    into the new local lab4 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab3 into the
    new lab4 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab3</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commiting to
    the local lab4 branch:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab4 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You should first import the new lab4 code into
    your favorite IDE. There
    are a bunch of new files that you
    should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    cfg/lab4/LivenessLattice.java  liveness analysis framework
    cfg/lab4/ZeroAnalysis.java     zero analysis framework
    util/lattice/*                 lattice class definitions
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished this lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.

<!-- part A -->
<h2>Part A: Lattice</h2>
<p>
In compiler, lattice theory provides the mathematical foundation for data
flow analysis. In this part, you'll learn and implement three types of
lattices, and implement the operations to compute their least upper bounds.
</p>

<h3>Diamond Lattice</h3>

A diamond lattice is a common lattice structure in lattice theory that is
shaped like a diamond and consists of four elements, as shown in the following
figure. The intermediate layer of diamond lattice contains two elements, 
which are usually used to represent two different states in dataflow analysis.
For example, in zero analysis, it can represent zero or non-zero.

    <pre>
         &top;
       /    \
      M<sub>0</sub>     M<sub>1</sub>
       \    /
         &bot;
    </pre>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Finish the code in the file <code>util/lattice/DiamondLattice.java</code>
    to compute the least upper bound of two diamond lattice.
</div>

<h3>Flat Lattice</h3>

A flat lattice is a type of complete lattice of height 2, in which the
intermediate elements are some elements in a set that do not have a partial
order relation with each other.

    <pre>
          &top;
     /  /    \   \
    a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub>   ...  a<sub>n</sub>
     \  \    /   /
          &bot;
    </pre>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Finish the code in the file <code>util/lattice/FlatLattice.java</code>
    to compute the least upper bound of two flat lattices.
</div>

<h3>Powerset Lattice</h3>

A powerset lattice is a complete lattice formed by all subsets of a finite set.
In the dataflow analysis algorithms implemented in our previous labs, 
such as liveness analysis and reaching definitions analysis, their dataflow 
states can all be represented using powerset lattices.

    <pre>
        {a,b,c}
       /    |   \
     /      |     \
    {a,b} {a,c} {b,c}
    | \   /   \   / |
    |  \ /     \ /  |
    |  / \     / \  |
    {a}    {b}    {c}
      \     |     /
        \   |   /
            ∅
    </pre>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Finish the code in the file <code>util/lattice/PowerSetLattice.java</code>
    to compute the least upper bound of two powerset lattices.
</div>

<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: Zero Analysis</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will implement
    a zero analysis algorithm to determine whether variables 
    (and expressions) in a program can evaluate to zero. 
    This analysis uses a diamond lattice to represent the 
    possible states of a variable’s value:
    <pre>
         &top;
       /    \
      0     Z<sup>-0</sup>
       \    /
         &bot;
    </pre>
    The analysis propagates abstract values forward along the 
    control-flow graph using transfer functions and joins 
    information at control-flow merges, terminating when 
    the fixpoint is reached.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Finish the code in the file <code>cfg/lab4/ZeroAnalysis.java</code>
    to implement the zero analysis algorithm. 
</div>

<!-- part C -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part C: Liveness Lattice</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, You will use the powerset lattice introduced 
    in <b>Exercise 3</b> to restructure the liveness analysis from <b>Lab 2</b>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Fill in the code in the file <code>cfg/lab4/LivenessLattice.java</code>
    to implement the liveness analysis based on lattice.
</div>

<p>
    The monotonic framework is an abstract program analysis framework based on 
    lattice theory. 
    It ensures the termination and correctness of the analysis process by 
    defining monotonic operations over partially ordered sets to represent 
    program semantics. 
    A monotonic framework generally consists of three components: a lattice, 
    transfer functions, and a fixed-point iteration algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
    The Rustc compiler incorporates an exquisitely designed monotonic framework
    called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.Analysis.html">Analysis trait</a>. 
    This framework primarily includes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Domain: Records data flow states at given program locations while 
        requiring satisfaction of a partial ordering relation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Direction: Specifies the analysis orientation (Forward or Backward).
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer functions: Evaluates the impact of a given statement 
        (statement or transfer) on the current data flow state.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed-point algorithm: iteratively computes the solution to data 
        flow problems.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    By defining the analysis domain, direction, and transfer function for the 
    analysis process (the fixed-point algorithm is officially provided, 
    requiring no user implementation), various program analysis algorithms 
    can be implemented efficiently.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    Reference the design of the <b>Analysis trait</b> in Rustc and propose a 
    monotonic framework for the dargon compiler to accommodate all data flow 
    analysis algorithms in <b>Lab 2</b>.
