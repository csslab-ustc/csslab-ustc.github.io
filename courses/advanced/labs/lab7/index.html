<h1>Lab 7: Static Single-Assignment Form</h1>

<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will build a static
    single-assignment form (SSA) for your Tiger compiler
    to perform optimizations. SSA is a
    state-of-the-art IR also used in production compilers
    such as GCC or LLVM.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of two parts: first, in part A, you will
    design and implement data structures defining the
    static single-assigment form. You will also implement
    translations from CFG to SSA as well as translations from SSA back
    to CFG.
    Second, in part B, you will implement several
    classic data-flow analysis
    and optimizations on SSA.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source we offered you for lab7:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab6'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab7 origin/lab7</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    these commands will first commit your changes to the lab6
    branch of your local Git repository, and then
    create a local lab7 branch and check out the remote lab7 branch
    into the new local lab7 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab6 into the
    new lab7 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab6</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commit to
    the local lab7 branch:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab7 init'</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
    You should first import the new lab7 code into
    your favorite IDE, and make sure the code compiles. There
    are a bunch of new files that you
    should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    ssa/*:    static single-assignment form and its operations
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished your lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.
</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Part A: Static Single-Assignment Form (SSA)</h2>
<p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form">
    static single-assignment form</a>
    (SSA) is an important compiler intermediate representation,
    in which each variable is assigned (statically) at most once.
    SSA is more advantageous over other compiler IRs in that
    its single-assignment property makes program analysis and optimization
    simpler and more efficient.
    As a result, SSA has become a de-factor IR in modern optimizing compilers
    for imperative, OO, or even functional languages.
</p>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will build a static single-assigment
    form for your Tiger compiler, and conduct optimizations
    based on your SSA IR.
    To aid in your implementation, we have given some hints for most
    exercises, but keep in mind that these hints are
    not mandatory, and you are free (and encouraged) to propose
    your own ideas.
</p>

<h3>SSA Data Structure</h3>
<p>
    To better reuse your existing code base,
    you will implement
    SSA by leveraging data structures already designed for
    the control-flow graph.
    This design decision
    makes the interfaces cleaner and more elegant
    hence simplifying subsequent compilation phases.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the code defining the SSA data structures in the file
    <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>.
    A basic block b might contain a list of &phi;-instructions, which
    reside at the top of a block.
    Syntactically, a &phi;-function
    <pre class="code">
        x = &phi;((B_1, x_1), (B_2, x_2), ..., (B_p, x_p))</pre>
    takes a list of tuples
    <code>(B_i, x_i), 1&le; i &le; p</code> as arguments
    and selects one of the variable <code>x_j</code> from
    these tuples as
    its value to assign to the left-side <code>x</code>, when
    the control-flow reach the current basic block from its
    predecessor <code>B_j</code>.
    Your task is to extend the SSA data structures with
    other necessary syntactic features, to support the compilation
    of full MiniJava.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Finish the code, in the file
    <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>, to visualize an
    SSA graph, that is, to draw the SSA graph
    with <a href="https://graphviz.org/">dot</a>.
</div>

<h3>Dominator Trees</h3>
<p>
    You will be constructing the SSA form with the
    following 5 steps:
    1) calculate dominators;
    2) build dominator trees;
    3) calculate dominance frontiers;
    4) place &phi;-functions; and
    5) rename variables.
</p>
<p>
    In this part, you will finish the first two steps, that is,
    you will first calculate dominators then build a dominator
    tree for a given CFG.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Calculate, for each node <code>n</code> in the control-flow
    graph, the dominators <code>DOM[n]</code> for the node <code>n</code>.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>dominators()</code>
    in the file <code>util/Graph.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: to keep your implementation simple, you might use
    the following data-flow equation to compute dominators directly:
    <pre class="code">
        DOM[n] = {n} &bigcup; (&bigcap;<sub>p&in; pred[n]</sub> DOM[p])</pre>
    where <code>DOM[n<sub>0</sub>] = {n<sub>0</sub>}</code> for
    the entry block <code>n<sub>0</sub></code>.<br>
    Hint: you might first topological-sort the control-flow graph to
    speed up the calculation, as this equation is forward in nature.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    While the data-flow equation based algorithm is
    easy to engineer, it is worst-time complexity is
    <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>
    due to its use of iterations to reach
    the fixpoint. Implement a more efficient algorithm
    to calculate dominators. You might consider the
    <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150FP/archive/keith-cooper/dom14.pdf">Cooper's
        algorithm</a>
    as a starting point.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Calculate, for a control-flow
    graph <code>g</code>, its dominator tree <code>t</code>.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>dominatorTree()</code>
    in the file <code>util/Graph.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: you should make use of the dominators <code>DOM[n]</code>
    already calculated
    for the node <code>n</code>, and think carefully about the basic
    data structure design to implement this algorithm.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Calculate, for a node <code>n</code> in control-flow
    graph <code>g</code>, its immediate dominator <code>IDOM[n]</code>.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>idom()</code>
    in the file <code>util/Graph.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: you might extend the tree
    data structure to implement this algorithm.
</div>

<h3>Dominance Frontier</h3>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will be implementing the
    third step to build an SSA, that is, you will calculate
    the dominance frontier for each node.
    The dominance frontier <code>DF[n]</code> of a node <code>n</code> is the
    set of all nodes <code>d</code> such that <code>n</code>
    dominates an immediate predecessor of <code>d</code>, but <code>n</code>
    does not strictly dominate <code>d</code>.
    Intuitively, the dominance frontier <code>DF[n]</code>
    for a node <code>n</code> is the set of nodes where <code>n</code>'s
    dominance stops.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Implement the algorithm calculating dominance frontiers <code>DF[n]</code>
    for any node <code>n</code> in the CFG.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>dominanceFrontier()</code>
    in the file <code>util/Graph.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: to keep your implementation simpler,
    you may use the following algorithm to calculate dominance
    frontier:
    <pre class="code">
    dominanceFrontier()
        foreach(node n &in; CFG)
            DF[n] = &emptyset;  // initialized to an empty set
        foreach(node n &in; CFG)
            if(n has multiple predecessors)
                foreach(predecessor p of n)
                    runner = p
                    while(runner &ne; IDOM[n])
                        DF[runner] &bigcup;= {n}
                        runner = IDOM[runner]</pre>
    where <code>IDOM[n]</code> represents
    the immediate dominator for the node <code>n</code>.
</div>

<h3>&phi;-function Placement</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you will implement the fourth step to build an SSA,
    that is, you will be implementing the &phi;-function placement.
    The &phi;-function placement algorithm places &phi;-functions at
    the top of corresponding blocks.
    Specifically, for a definition
</p>
<pre class="code">x = ...</pre>
<p>
    to a variable
    <code>x</code> in a basic block
    <code>n</code>, this algorithm will place a &phi;-function
</p>
<pre class="code">x = &phi;(x, ..., x)</pre>
<p>
    at the top of each <code>n</code>'s
    dominance frontier <code>d &in; DF[n]</code>.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    Implement the algorithm to place the &phi;-functions, as
    described by Algorithm 19.6 in the Tiger book.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>placePhiFunctions()</code>
    in the file <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: for any basic block <code>b</code>, take care not to
    place &phi;-functions more than once
    for a same variable <code>x</code>.<br>
    Hint: &phi;-function placement has a cascaded effect, that is,
    placing a &phi;-function for a variable <code>x</code>
    at a basic block <code>b</code> also
    makes <code>b</code> a definition block for <code>x</code>.
</div>

<h3>Renaming the Variables</h3>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will be implementing the
    fifth and last step to build an SSA, that is, you will rename
    variables to make its definition unique.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    Implement the algorithm to rename the variables, as
    described by Algorithm 19.7 in the Tiger book.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>renameVariables()</code>
    in the file <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>.<br>
    Hint: think carefully about basic data structure design
    (e.g., variable versions, and stacks).<br>
    Hint: to keep your implementation simple, you might want
    to use a functional programming style, that is, you should
    construct a new function from an old one instead of
    modifying the old one in place.
</div>
<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler can convert all legal MiniJava
    programs to SSA forms. Do regression test your Tiger compiler
    and fix potential bugs.
</p>

<h3>Translation Out of SSA Forms</h3>
<p>
    Modern machines do not support the &phi;-functions
    directly, hence &phi;-functions must be eliminated
    before execution. This task is accomplished by the
    translation out of SSA forms.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
    Implement the algorithm to translate a program
    out of SSA form. Specifically, to avoid
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75703913/how-to-eliminate-phi-instructions-in-transformed-ssa">
        the lost-copy
        problem and the swap problem</a>,
    you might use the following algorithm:
    <pre class="code">
    outSSA(ssa)
        splitCriticalEdges(ssa);
        foreach(basic block b, with p predecessors b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>p</sub>)
            suppose b contains m &phi;-functions:
                x<sub>1</sub> = &phi;(x<sub>11</sub>, ..., x<sub>1p</sub>);
                ...
                x<sub>m</sub> = &phi;(x<sub>m1</sub>, ..., x<sub>mp</sub>);
            generate m fresh variables: t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>m</sub>;
            foreach(b's predecessor block b<sub>i</sub>, 1&le; i &le;p)
                append these assignment statements at the tail of block b<sub>i</sub>:
                    t<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>1i</sub>
                    ...
                    t<sub>m</sub> = x<sub>mi</sub>
            append these assigment statements at the top of block b:
                x<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>1</sub>
                ...
                x<sub>m</sub> = t<sub>m</sub></pre>
    where the function <code>splitCriticalEdges()</code> splits
    critical edges in a directed graph.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in the
    method <code>splitCriticalEdges()</code>
    in the file <code>util/Graph.java</code>,
    and by filling in the method <code>outSsa()</code>
    in the file <code>cfg/Cfg.java</code>.
</div>
<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler can convert any
    SSA form back to a corresponding CFG.
    Do not forget to regression test your Tiger compiler.
</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Part B: SSA-based Optimizations</h2>
<p>
    SSA makes compiler optimizations not only
    easier to engineer but also more efficient to execute, largely
    due to its single-assignment property.
    This nice property make it
    much easier to calculate the data-flow information
    required to perform optimizations.
</p>

<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will re-implement several optimizations
    that we have done on the CFG on SSA again: dead code-elimination,
    constant propagation, copy propagation, among others.
    And you will also implement several novel optimizations that
    are particularly suitable for SSA: conditional constant propagation,
    global value numbering, among others.
</p>

<h3>Dead-code Elimination</h3>
<p>
    In SSA, a statement <code>x = e</code> is dead,
    if the variable <code>x</code> is not used by any other
    statement (and <code>e</code> does not have side effects).
    As a result, this statement <code>x = e</code> can be safely
    eliminated.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
    Implement the dead-code optimization on SSA.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in
    methods in the file <code>ssa/DeadCode.java</code>.
    Note that &phi;-functions are also assignment statements
    hence candidates for dead-code elimination.
</div>

<h3>Constant Propagation</h3>
<p>
    In SSA, given a statement of the form <code>x = c</code> in which
    <code>c</code> is a constant, we can propagate the constant <code>c</code>
    to any use of variable <code>x</code>.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
    Implement the constant propagation optimization on SSA.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in
    methods in the file <code>ssa/ConstProp.java</code>.
    Note that after the constant propagation optimizations,
    the assigment statement <code>x = c</code>
    might become dead statement,
    manifesting opportunities for dead-code elimination optimizations.
</div>

<h3>Copy Propagation</h3>
<p>
    In SSA, given a copy statement <code>x = y</code>, then
    any use of <code>x</code> can be replaced by <code>y</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
    Implement the copy propagation algorithm on SSA.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in methods in the file
    <code>ssa/CopyProp.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>&phi;-function Elimination</h3>
<p>
    In SSA, if a &phi;-function is of a special form
    taking a list of same arguments:
</p>
<pre class="code">x = &phi;(c, c, ..., c)</pre>
<p>
    where <code>c</code> is a constant,
    then this &phi;-function can be eliminated by rewriting
    it to a normal assignment to <code>x</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code">x = c</pre>
<p>
    Note that, often the time,
    this special form of &phi;-function <code>x = &phi;(c, c, ..., c)</code>
    might be generated by constant propagation optimizations,
    which substituted &phi;-function arguments by constants.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, the &phi;-function:
</p>
<pre class="code">x = &phi;(y, y, ..., y)</pre>
<p>
    can be eliminated by rewriting
    it to an assignment statement:
</p>
<pre class="code">x = y</pre>
<p>
    where <code>y</code> is a variable.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 13.</span>
    Implement the &phi;-function elimination optimization on SSA.
    You should finish this exercise by filling in methods in the file
    <code>ssa/PhiElim.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Conditional Constant Propagation</h3>

    optimizations.
