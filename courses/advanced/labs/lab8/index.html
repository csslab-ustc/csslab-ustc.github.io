<h1>Lab 8: Virtual Machines</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, your task is to build a code generator
    targeting the Java bytecode (i.e., Java's standard
    binary code format), to build a virtual machine
    to interpret the result bytecode, then to implement
    a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source for lab8 at:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab7'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab8 origin/lab8</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    the first command will commit your changes to lab7 branch
    to the local
    Git repository, and the second command will
    create a new local lab8 branch and check out code
    into this new branch from the remote lab8 branch.
</p>

<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab7 into the
    new local lab8 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab7</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commit to
    the local lab8 branch:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab8 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You should first import the new lab8 code into your Eclipse and
    browse through the source code, which contains these
    new packages:
</p>
<pre>
    bytecode/*: the Java bytecode
    vm/*:       virtual machine
</pre>
<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished your lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="">online teaching system</a>.
</p>

<h2>Part A: Java Bytecode</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, your job is to design and implement a
    code generator generating
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java bytecode</a>
    targeting the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual
        machine (JVM)</a>. Java bytecode
    is designed by Sun (now Oracle) and is the standard
    target code for Java. Though there are
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines">many JVMs</a> available, the one
    we will use in the lab is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotSpot">HotSpot</a> JVM developed by Oracle (so you
    don't need to do further work of installation or configuration, as we have
    been using HotSpot to compile
    the Tiger compiler). However, there
    is nothing special with HotSpot, you can use other JVMs as
    long as they conform to the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/">JVM specification</a>.
</p>

<h3>Abstract Syntax defining Java Bytecode</h3>
<p>
    In this part, we will design and implement
    a bunch of data structures defining abstract syntax for
    Java bytecode. However, we must address several
    difficulties: first, the standard
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings">
        Java bytecode instruction set</a>
    contains many more instructions than actually needed to compile MiniJava.
    For instance, we do not need
    bytecode instructions for floating point operations as MiniJava does
    not support float numbers.
    Second, the official
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se22/html/">
        Java bytecode specification</a>
    only specifies binary formats for
    bytecode instructions, which is good for JVM execution but
    difficult for compilers to manipulate and generate code for.
</p>
<p>
    To address the first difficulty, you must select, from the
    Java bytecode instruction set, a subset that is enough to compile
    the MiniJava.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Select a subset of Java bytecode to compile MiniJava.
</div>
<p>
    To resolve the second difficulty, one can
    choose a Java bytecode assembler which can assemble
    instuctions in readable text form into binary forms which can be
    executed by a JVM. This process is very much like that
    a traditional assembler assembles assembly program
    into binaries. With the bytecode assembler, your
    Tiger compiler can generate text form Java bytecode instuctions and
    leave the tedious work of assembling to the bytecode
    assembler. Nevertheless, writing a bytecode assembler
    from scractch is, though conceptually simple, tedious and
    too much work. Fortunately, there are some mature thirdparty assembler
    that you can use in your Tiger compiler. To be specific, the Java
    bytecode assembler you'll
    use in this lab is called Jasmin. There is no specific reason
    why we choose Jasmin among many such assemblers. But Jasmin
    has been the oldest Java bytecode assembler and has been used
    widely in many projects. Jasmin has become the de-facto assembly format for Java bytecode.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Take a look at the <a href="https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/">
    Jasmin homepage</a> and read the <a href="https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/guide.html">user
    guide</a> to familarize yourself with how Jasmin works. As a test, you
    should compile and run the
    <a href="https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/about.html"><code>HelloWorld</code></a>
    bytecode program. You can use the HotSpot JVM from Sun to run
    the generated Java classes.
</div>

As we are using Jasmin assembler to assemble the Java bytecode, so
it will be very convenient to design the Java bytecode abstract
syntax tree data structures according to the Jasmin syntax.
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    The package <code>codegen.bytecode.*</code>
    contains the data structures to represent Java
    bytecode abstract syntax trees. You may want to refer
    to the <a href="https://jasmin.sourceforge.net/xt.html">Jasmin XT</a>
    syntax for this. The package <code>codegen.bytecode.stm.*</code>
    contains the abstract syntax for Java bytecode instructions. You may want to
    refer to the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~mis/dOvs/jvmspec/ref-Java.html">Java
    Virtual Machine online instruction reference</a>
    for a detailed explanation of the syntax and semantics for each
    instruction. It should be easy to know which class represents
    which instruction, because they have the same name (for instance, the
    <code>New.java</code> class represents the
    <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~mis/dOvs/jvmspec/ref-new.html"><code>new</code></a>
    instruction. Make sure you understand all the existing code base before
    continuing. When in doubt, refer to the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html">official JVM
        manual</a> (chapter 6).

    A final word of reminder, the classes in the
    <code>codegen.bytecode.stm.*</code> package we offered you
    is NOT sufficient to
    compile the MiniJava language. It's your task, in the
    following, to figure out what other instructions are
    necessary and how to implement them.
</div>


<h3>Generating Java Bytecode</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you'll write the Java bytecode generator for
    Tiger. This generator is (once again) a visitor which
    translates the
    Java syntax tree into the Java bytecode syntax tree. For this
    purpose, you should have a thorough understanding of
    how a JVM works and especially how to compile
    Java features to corresponding Java bytecode feature. The
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-3.html">chapter 3</a>
    of the JVM specification documents the compiling techniques
    from Java to Java bytecode, read this document if
    you haven't.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
    Finish the Java bytecode generator in the class
    <code>codegen.bytecode.TranslateVisitor.java</code>. Feel free to modify
    other parts of your Tiger compiler when necessary: the Java bytecode syntax
    tree, the pretty
    printer, the Java abstract syntax tree, the elabortor, and so on.
</div>
For the generated Java bytecode, use Jasmin to assemble it and
then use a JVM to run it. You don't need to
write runtime system or garbage collectors, for they come with the
JVM (for free).

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    If your Java bytecode generator contains any bugs, it's often the case
    that the generated bytecode will behave incorrectly in the following
    ways:
    <ul>
        <li>the generated Java bytecode doesn't compile (rejected by the Jasmin assembler);
        <li>the generated Java bytecode doesn't verify (rejected by any standards-compliant <a
                href="https://asm.ow2.org/">class verifier</a>);
        <li>the generated Java bytecode doesn't run (rejected by the JVM).
    </ul>
    For these cases, the
    diagnostic messages will be helpful for you to locate where
    the bugs are and what they are. However,
    it is also helpful to have more debugging facilities, here are some
    directions you can go:
    <ul>
        <li>Modify your Java bytecode generator to generate debuggable
            Java bytecode. For instance, you can annotate the generated Java
            bytecode with the source program being compiled. Here is one example:
            for the Java expression
            <code>1+2</code>, your
            code generator may generate this code (expressions generated
            as comments followed by the instructions generated for
            it):
            <pre>
  ; 1 + 2
  ldc 1
  ldc 2
  add
</pre>
        <li>Use Jasmin's built-in debugging facilitis: such as
            the <code>-g</code> option and the <code>.line</code>
            directive.
        <li>Use some third party debuggin tools, such as
            <a href="https://www.drgarbage.com/bytecode-visualizer.html">
                bytecode-visualizer</a>.
    </ul>
    Implement some of the ideas into your Tiger compiler.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    There is a weird static constraint on the code size of a method, to quote
    from the
    <i><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9">
        Java Virtual Machine Specification</a></i>, section 4.9.1:
    <pre>
     the value of code_length item must be less than 65536.
</pre>
    that is, the generated Java bytecode for any Java methods should
    be less than 65536 bytes. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to
    compile a very large Java method (for instance, the Monster class
    from Lab 1). Propose some techniques to make compilation of
    large methods possible, and try to implement into your Tiger
    compiler so that your Tiger compiler can compile any large
    Java programs.

<h2>Part B: Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>
    One will get real justification if one can generate code
    for real raw machine. In this part of the lab, you will design
    and implement another
    code generator targeting the x86 instruction set architecture. We'll
    give no code here, so it's your duty to write the code
    from scratch.
</p>


<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    Write a virtual machine...
