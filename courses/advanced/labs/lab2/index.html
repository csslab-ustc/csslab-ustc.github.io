<h1>Lab 2: Data-flow analysis</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and implement a dominator tree algorithm, a 
    foundational tool for code optimization. 
    Additionally, you will develop a liveness analysis, a classical backward 
    data flow analysis algorithm, and a reaching definitions analysis, 
    a classical forward data flow analysis algorithm.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the code skeleton for this lab:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will commit your changes to 'lab1' branch
    to your local Git repository, and create and check out a new lab2
    branch from the remote lab2 branch.
</p>
<p>
    You will now need to merge the lab1 into the lab2:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab1</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how
    to merge your changes with the new lab assignment
    (e.g., if you modified some of the code that is changed
    in the second lab assignment). In that case, the git
    merge command will report you which files are conflicted,
    and you should first resolve the conflict (by editing
    the relevant files) and then commit the resulting files:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab2 init'</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
    Lab 2 contains the following new source files,
    which you should browse through:
</p>

<pre>
    cfg/lab2/Dominator.java:            dominator tree algorithm framework
    cfg/lab2/Liveness.java:             liveness analyses framework
    cfg/lab2/ReachDefinition.java:      reaching definition analyses framework
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished your lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">online teaching system</a>.

<h1>Part A: Dominator Tree</h1>
<p>
    In program optimization and analysis, Dominator Tree is a tree structure 
    used to represent the dominance relationship between nodes in a Control Flow 
    Graph (CFG). It is an important tool in compiler design and static program 
    analysis, especially in optimizations (such as loop optimization, dead code 
    elimination) and data flow analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Let <code>DOM[n]</code> represent the dominator of node <code>n</code>. 
    A simple and intuitive way to construct a dominating tree is to utilize
    the following data-flow equation:
    <pre class="code">
        DOM[n] = {n} &bigcup; (&bigcap;<sub>p&in; pred[n]</sub> DOM[p])</pre>
    where <code>DOM[n<sub>0</sub>] = {n<sub>0</sub>}</code> for
    the entry block <code>n<sub>0</sub></code>.<br>
</p>
<p>
    While the data-flow equation based algorithm is easy to engineer, it is 
    worst-time complexity is <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> due to its use of 
    iterations to reach the fixpoint. 
    In this part, you should implement a more efficient algorithm to construct
    dominator tree using Cooper's algorithm.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Complete the missing code in file <code>src/cfg/lab2/Dominator.java</code>
    and build a dominator tree from the control flow graph. You can refer to the
    readings we provided and
    <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150FP/archive/keith-cooper/dom14.pdf">this paper</a>
    to learn how Cooper's algorithm works.
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>Part B: Liveness Analysis</h1>
<p>
    A
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness_analysis">liveness analysis</a>
    calculates, for each statement
    and transfer in a function, the live-in and live-out variable sets.
    In liveness analysis, you should calculate
    <code>in</code> and <code>live_out</code> for the <code>in</code>
    and <code>out</code> separately; and the fix-point code should
    calculate the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> sets for
    each basic block in a reverse topo-sort order.
    But for other data-flow analysis, these details may be different.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Finish the liveness analysis code in the source file
    <code>cfg/lab2/Liveness.java</code> by implementing the
    aforementioned algorithm.
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>Part C: Reaching Definition Analysis</h1>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, You will implement a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaching_definition">reaching definition analysis</a>
    , which tracks the values of variables in a program. 
    Through reaching definition analysis, we can detect the use of undefined 
    variables in the program or perform constant propagation and 
    copy propagation.
</p>

<p>
    The reaching definition analysis algorithm we designed primarily consists 
    of two steps: analyzing variable definition points and iteratively solving 
    data flow equations.
</p>

<h3>
    Variable Definition Points Analysis
</h3>

<p>
    The analysis of variable definition points is primarily performed to 
    compute the information required for data flow equations. This step 
    involves traversing each function and recording every definition point of 
    variables within the function.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Read and understand the source code in the file 
    <code>cfg/lab2/ReachDefinition.java</code>, then fill in the function 
    <code>defsForFunction()</code>.
    <br>
    You can utilize <code>defSitesProp</code> to record variable 
    definition site.
</div>

<h3>
    Gen-Kill Computation
</h3>
<p>
    Prior to solving data flow equations, we must also implement functions to 
    compute the gen/kill sets for each program statement. For each statement 
    <code>d: t = x1 op x2</code>, the <em>GEN</em> set is computed as 
    <code>Gen[d] = {d}</code>, and the <em>KILL</em> set is calculated by 
    <code>Kill[d]=defs[t]-{d}</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Read and understand the source code in the file 
    <code>cfg/lab2/ReachDefinition.java</code>, then fill in the function 
    <code>gkStm()</code>.
</div>

<h3>
    Solving Data Flow Equations
</h3>
<p>
    The solution of data flow equations typically employs a fixed-point 
    algorithm. This involves maintaining a state table where each iteration 
    recomputes the current state. If the state in the current iteration differs 
    from the previous iteration, the algorithm proceeds to the next round until 
    a stable convergence state—referred to as the fixed point—is reached.
    <br>
    It is noteworthy that reaching definition analysis is a <em>forward</em> 
    data flow analysis. For each statement <code>s</code>, its <em>In</em> set 
    is the union of the <em>Out</em> sets from all its predecessor statements: 
    <code><em>In</em>[s] = 
        &bigcup;<sub>p&in;pred[s]</sub><em>Out</em>[pred]</code>, 
    while its <em>Out</em> set is computed by 
    <code><em>Out</em>[s] = 
        <em>Gen</em>[s] &bigcup; (<em>In</em>[s] - <em>Kill</em>[s])</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Implement the fixed-point algorithm in the <code>doitFunction()</code> 
    and complete the <code>doitStm()</code> and <code>doitTransfer()</code> 
    functions to compute the <em>In</em>/<em>Out</em> sets for each program 
    statement/transfer. 
    Afterwards, you can validate your implementation by invoking the 
    <code>test()</code> function within the embedded class <code>UnitTest</code>.
