        <h1>Principle of Programming Languages</h1>
        <h2>Spring 2025</h2>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This course teaches the principle of design and implementation
            of programming languages. This year, we will concentrate on
            techniques for program analysis and optimizations.
            We will discuss static analysis techniques including
            but not limited to intermediate representations,
            control-flow analysis, data-flow analysis,
            lattice and fix-points,
            inter-procedural analysis, pointer analysis,
            and abstract interpretations.
            We will also discuss dynamic analysis techniques including
            but not limited to fuzzing, dynamic program analysis,
            and sanitizations.
            Most importantly, you will study the interactions
            between theory and practice by implementing these techniques, thus
            gain a deep understanding.
