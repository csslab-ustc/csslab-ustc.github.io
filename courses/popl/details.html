                            <h3>Textbook and Reference</h3>
                            The following textbook is recommended:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Types and Programming Languages. - by Benjamin C.Pierce
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Besides this, we'll also post some papers or reading as supplementary
                                materials. It's very important that you read the textbook or
                                papers in advance. There are also some references and
                                resources on the course web page.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Homework</h3>
                            <p>
                                Homeworks (including the programming assignments and projects)
                                should be attempted individually. If you have any difficulty
                                in solving these problems, you may discuss with your classmates,
                                the instructor or the TAs etc.
                                on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kzs4b7kncxc5rv">Piazza Forum</a>,
                                but final submitted work should be your own.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Late homeworks will NOT be accepted, for ANY reasons.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The final score is evaluated based on homework, project and final
                                test according to this strategy (subject to change in the future):
                            <ul>
                                <li>30%: homework</li>
                                <li>70%: final test</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
