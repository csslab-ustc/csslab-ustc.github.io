        <h3>Compiler: Practice First</h3>
        <p>
            This course is organized in three parts: lectures, paper
            readings, and labs. The
            lectures cover basic topics and familiarize you with the main
            concepts, and the paper readings familiarize you with the latest
            research progress in current literatures.
            The lab section forces you to understand the concepts at a deeper
            level, since you will build a working compiler from the ground up. After
            the lab, you will understand the internals of a rather
            complex compiler and the compilation in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            The compiler you will build, called <em>Tiger</em>, compiles a subset
            of the
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/">Java programming language</a>,
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> instruction set
            architecture.
            After finishing the core components of this compiler,
            you will also have the opportunities
            to expand the compiler extensively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major components of the Tiger compiler that you will be
            implementing include, but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lexer and Parser</li>
            <li>Abstract Syntax Trees and Type Checker</li>
            <li>Intermediate Representation</li>
            <li>Control-flow Graph</li>
            <li>Instruction Selection</li>
            <li>Register Allocation</li>
            <li>Garbage collector</li>
            <li>Static Single-assignment and Optimizations</li>
            <li>Runtime and library</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            And there will be a final project, in which you are
            encouraged to propose your own ideas and implement them
            into your compiler.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each lab,
            we will provide skeleton code for you to start with.
            But you will
            have to do all the hard work. You will have design freedom for
            the details of most data structures and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the course, you will be able to find your way
            around the source code of most compilers, and more generally, be
            comfortable with compiler software. You will understand many
            compiler concepts in detail and will be able to use
            them in other environments. You will also understand the
            Java programming language, the Java bytecode and
            general OO programming techniques well.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
            For homework or labs, you may not collaborate with others;
            you may discuss with
            your classmates or the staffs, but the final work must be
            your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do NOT post your solutions to lab or homework on publicly
            accessible websites or file spaces. Do NOT refer to the
            similar code on public webs.
