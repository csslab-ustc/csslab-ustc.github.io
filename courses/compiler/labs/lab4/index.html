<h1>Lab 4: Instruction Selection</h1>

<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and implement an instruction
    selector for your <code>Tiger</code> compiler, to translate
    MiniJava programs to x64 assembly.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of three parts: first, in part A, you
    will design and implement data structures for the x64
    assembly language serving as the target for instruction
    selection.
    Second, in part B, you will design and implement a simple
    object model for MiniJava and determine field offsets,
    method offsets, and class sizes, among others.
    Finally, in part C, you will implement a maximum munch
    algorithm to lower down the CFG to the x64 assembly.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source we offered you for lab 4:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab3'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab4 origin/lab4</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    these commands will first commit your changes to the lab3
    branch of your local Git repository, and then create a
    local lab4 branch and check out the remote lab4 branch
    into the new local lab4 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab3 into the
    new lab4 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab3</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commiting to
    the local lab4 branch:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab4 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You should first import the new lab4 code into
    your favorite IDE. There
    are a bunch of new files that you
    should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    codegen/*:    data structures and operations for x64
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished this lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.
</p>

<h2>Part A: X64 Assembly</h2>
<p>
    Intel x64 is a widely used CSIC instruction set architecture
    (ISA) we will generate code for in this lab.
    In this part of the lab, you will first design
    data structures and operations for x64.
</p>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<p>
    While the x64 is a complex ISA, we will, in this lab, only use
    a small subset of it which is enough
    to compile MiniJava. You may want to refer to
    <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf">
        some manual</a> for this subset,
    if you are not familiar with this ISA.
</p>
<p>
    The data structures defining x64 is essentially
    an assembly-level control-flow graph (as we have
    discussed in the previous lab). The most interesting
    part is how we represent assembly instructions.
</p>
<p>
    At this phase, an assembly instruction may still
    contain variables (we call them pseudo-registers),
    which will be allocated to physical
    registers by a register allocator (as will be discussed
    in the next lab). For example, an addition
    instruction may look like:
</p>
<pre><code>addq %y, %x   // %x = %x + %y</code></pre>
<p>
    where both <code>%x</code> and <code>%y</code> are
    variables yet to be allocated to registers.
    Hence, an assembly instruction in this phase
    can be treated as a function mapping variables to
    a concrete assembly instruction string in which
    pseudo-registers substituted by physical registers.
    For example, if we can determine this allocation:
</p>
<pre><code>[%x -> %rax, %y -> %rbx]</code></pre>
<p>
    Then the aforementioned instruction can be converted into:
</p>
<pre><code>addq %rbx, %rax</code></pre>
<p>
    With this key insight, we can encode an assembly instruction
    using a higher-order function taking varying components
    (i.e., variables)
    as arguments. Specifically,
    we will use a &lambda; taking the variables as parameters
    to concatenate the final assembly string.
    Consider the above example, its &lambda; encoding
    may look like:
</p>
<pre><code>&lambda;([%x, %y]).(addq %y, %x)</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Furthermore, to distinguish variable uses and defs,
    we put two arguments for a &lambda;, one for the
    variable uses and the other one for the defs.
    With this elaboration, the above instruction can be
    encoded by the following two-argument &lambda;:
</p>
<pre><code>&lambda;([%x, %y], [%x]).(addq %y, %x)</code>
</pre>
<p>
    where <code>[%x, %y]</code> are uses, and <code>[%x]</code>
    is def.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the code in <code>codegen/X64.java</code>, to
    understand data structures defining x64.
    Feel free to extend these data structures and operations
    when necessary.
</div>

<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: Object Layout</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will implement
    an object layout algorithm to determine the layout
    of each object, consisting of
    two sub-algorithms. First, for a class, your algorithm will
    determine the total size of that class as well as the layout
    of its virtual method table.
    Second, for an object,
    the algorithm will determine the layout of its containing
    fields, including implicit fields such as the virtual method table
    pointer.
</p>

<p>
    In subsequent labs, you will extend this object layout to support
    other OO features, such as garbage collections (or monitors in
    full Java).
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Finish the code in the file <code>codegen/Layout.java</code>
    to calculate the size of a class as well as offsets
    for each field in a class, respectively.
    For simplicity, you can treat the size of an MiniJava
    integer (i.e., type <code>int</code>) as 8,
    which is the same as a reference (pointer).
</div>

<!-- part C -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part C: Instruction Selection</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will implement
    an instruction selector based on the maximum munch
    algorithm to lower down the CFG to x64 assembly.
</p>

<h3>Maximum Munch Algorithm</h3>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Fill in the code in the file <code>codegen/Munch.java</code>,
    to select x64 instructions for statements in the CFG.
</div>

<h3>Calling Convention</h3>
<p>
    A calling convention specifies how arguments and returned
    values are passed between a callee and a caller.
    Before implementing the calling convention for X64,
    You should first get familiarized yourself with
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/x86-64-ABI/abi.pdf?job=build">
        the X64 ABI</a> (Section 3.2).
    As MiniJava only has 64-bits integers and references, so
    make sure to answer these questions: 1) how arguments
    are passed from the caller to the callee? 2) how returned
    values are passed from the callee to the caller
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Extend Tiger's calling convention implementation
    to support arguments more than 6, so that your Tiger
    compiler can compile programs with arbitrary number
    of arguments.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red-zone</a>
    is a special area on the stack frame.
    Propose your strategy to exploit the red-zone, to
    improve efficiency of the generated code.
    Implement your idea into your Tiger compiler.
</div>

<h3>Prologue and Epilogue</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue_and_epilogue">
    function prologue</a> is a fragment of assembly code
    at the beginning of
    a function, which prepare the call stack and registers for
    use within the function. Similarly, a function epilogue
    appears at the end of the function, and restores the stack
    and registers to the state they were in before the function
    was called.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Implement function prologue and epilogue for Tiger.
    You can treat the size of the function frame as 0
    (which will be determined by the register allocator
    in the next lab).
    To keep things simple, you can save all callee-saved
    registers in the prologue and restore them in the epilogue,
    regardless of whether the variable is used in the callee.
    Furthermore, your Tiger compiler can always use <code>%rbp</code>
    as the stack frame base pointer.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, you Tiger compiler should
    generate X64 assembly for all MiniJava programs.
    Do not forget to test your compiler before continuing.
