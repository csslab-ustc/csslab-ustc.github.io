<h1>Lab 2: Abstract Syntax Tree and Type Checker</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and
    implement an abstract syntax tree as well as a type checker
    for Tiger. To implement an abstract
    syntax tree, you will design a bunch of Java classes, and
    add semantic actions to the parser to generate
    abstract syntax trees automatically.
    To implement the type checker, you will design symbol tables
    as well as type checking rules.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the code skeleton for this lab:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab1'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will commit your changes to 'lab1' branch
    to your local Git repository, and create and check out a new lab2
    branch from the remote lab2 branch.
</p>
<p>
    You will now need to merge the lab1 into the lab2:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab1</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    In some cases, Git may not be able to figure out how
    to merge your changes with the new lab assignment
    (e.g., if you modified some of the code that is changed
    in the second lab assignment). In that case, the git
    merge command will report you which files are conflicted,
    and you should first resolve the conflict (by editing
    the relevant files) and then commit the resulting files:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab2 init'</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
    Lab 2 contains the following new source files,
    which you should browse through:
</p>

<pre>
    src/ast/*:     abstract syntax tree data structure
    src/checker/*: symbol tables and the type checker
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished your lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">online teaching system</a>.
</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Part A: Abstract Syntax Trees</h1>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will first design and
    implement an abstract syntax tree for Tiger.
</p>
<p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read and understand the source code in the file <code>ast/Ast.java</code>,
    which encodes the abstract syntax for MiniJava.
    Refer to the
    <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~sguyer/classes/comp181-2006/minijava.html">
        MiniJava reference manual</a>
    for the MiniJava syntax.
</div>

<h3>Program Representation as Trees</h3>
<p>
    Given the data structure definitions for the MiniJava syntax, one
    can (in principle) manually encode any MiniJava program.
    While this method is, at first glance, boring and error-prone to do
    in everyday programming practice, it does allow a direct representation of
    program structures, and also is the dominant
    programming styles in some functional languages, like
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    In the file <code>ast/SamplePrograms.java</code>, we have offered you some
    code to encode several sample MiniJava program.
    Read the code and make sure
    you understand how those sample programs are represented.
    Then write code to encode the MiniJava
    program <code>test/Sum.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Pretty Printing</h3>
<p>
    As you have done in lab 1, you will implement a pretty
    printer in this part, which makes use of the pattern matching
    feature in Java.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Read the code in the file <code>ast/PrettyPrinter.java</code>,
    finish the pretty printer by filling in the missing code.
    Do not forget to test your code when you finished, you can
    start with the unit test code in <code>ast/Test.java</code>.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    While the pretty printer you have implemented is powerful
    enough to process MiniJava code, it may be not that general
    and powerful. Study some general pretty printing algorithms
    and implement them into your Tiger compilers. For example, you
    may start with
    <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf">
        Wadler's</a> printer.
</div>

<h3>Tree Generation</h3>
<p>
    The parser can construct the abstract syntax tree automatically by
    its semantic action attached with the parsing methods.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Modify the parser <code>src/parser/Parser.java</code> to add
    semantic actions to each parsing method. As the result of
    parsing, your Tiger compiler will return an abstract
    syntax tree for subsequent processing.
</div>
<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler should parse all legal
    MiniJava programs, generate abstract syntax trees, and
    perform pretty printing on the trees. Do not forget to
    test your compiler:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Tiger -trace parser.Parser.parse &lt;inputFile&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Fix any bugs before continuing.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    If you have tried parser generators from the previous lab, then
    you may generate abstract syntax trees from that parser by adding
    semantic actions into productions.
</div>

<hr/>
<h1>Part B: Type Checker</h1>
<p>
    A type checker inspects the abstract syntax trees for
    <em>well-formedness</em>, according to the
    MiniJava language specification which is in turn based on Java
    specification.
    Well-formedness guarantees that the input MiniJava program
    obey <em>all</em> constraint rules.
    For example, a variable must be
    declared before its use; the <code>"+"</code> operator
    must apply to two operands of integer type; the methods being
    invoked on an object must have
    been defined in its class or some superclass; and so on.
    In this part, you will be implementing a type checker for
    Tiger.
</p>

<h3>Symbol Tables</h3>
<p>
    Just like the pretty printing, a type checker
    performs some kind of (post-order) tree traversal.
    However, there is a key difference: the type checking
    traversal is context-sensitive, that is, it must record
    necessary context information. We can use dictionary
    data structures to record these information.
    For historical reason, such dictionaries
    are called
    <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_tables">symbol tables</a></em>.
</p>

<p>
    The design of the symbol table
    is highly-dependent on the language being compiled.
    For MiniJava, we have designed two symbol tables:
    1) a class table; and 2) a method table.
    A class table maps a class name to its
    to instance variables and methods.
    And a method table map a method name to its
    parameters and locals variables.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Read the code defining symbol table data structures in
    <code>src/checker/*</code>.
    We have provided you all code, make sure to understand the overall
    organization of these data structures.

    To debug your compiler implementation, you often need to
    dump the class table or method table. You can
    run your Tiger compiler with:
    <pre> $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Tiger -dump classtable
           -dump methodtable &lt;inputFile&gt;</kbd>
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Implementing Type Checking Rules</h3>
<p>
    A type checker performs a post-order traversal of
    an abstract syntax tree.
    That is, a type checker first inspects each subtree and calculates
    a type for that subtree, respectively.
    When the type checker returns to the root of the tree,
    it compares the types returned from all subtrees and
    guarantees those types can be combined properly into a
    result type before returning.
    For example, for the tree
    node <em>e1+e2</em>, the type checker first inspects the left subtree
    <em>e1</em> to
    calculate a type, say <em>t1</em>, then inspects the right subtree
    <em>e2</em> to calculate a type
    <em>t2</em>.
    At the type checker returns to the root node "+", it will check that
    both <em>t1</em> and <em>t2</em> are <em>int</em>, before returning
    a type <em>int</em> as the final result.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Finish the code in the type checker <code>src/checker/Checker.java</code>,
    by filling in the missing code.
    In implementing the type checker, you can run the following command
    <pre> $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Tiger -builtin SumRec.java</kbd>
</pre>
    in case that your parser has bugs.
</div>
<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler can type check
    all MiniJava programs. Do not forget to
    test your compiler and fix any bugs before continuing.
</p>

<h3>Error Recovery</h3>
<p>
    A type checker should report type errors
    to the programmers and should recover from type errors to
    detect and report as many errors as possible.
    The error recovery strategy in Tiger's
    current implementation is preliminary in
    that it only reports one error before exiting, but does not try
    to recover from an error.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    Propose a better error recovery strategy
    and implement it in your Tiger compiler.
</div>

<h3>Declaration and Usage</h3>
<p>
    Java, like many static languages, obeys a declaration-before-use
    rule, meaning that each variable in a program
    should have a unique static declaration site before all its usages.
    However, a variable declaration may have not been used at all.
    For such scenarios, the variable is said to be
    an <em>unused variable</em>. A good compiler might generate
    warning like:
</p>

<pre class="output">
    Warning: Variable 'x' is never used
</pre>
<p>
    which you might have observed in your Java IDE in this course.
</p>


<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    Extend your Tiger compiler to issue warnings for unused
    variables.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    In well-behaved Java programs, every variable should have been
    <em>initialized</em> before its usages, otherwise the usage
    of such a variable might produce unpredictable results.
    For uninitialized variables, good compilers might
    generate the following <em>error</em>:
    <pre class="output">
        Error: Variable 'x' might not have been initialized</pre>
    Propose a strategy to detect uninitialized variables,
    and implement your idea into your Tiger compiler.
</div>
