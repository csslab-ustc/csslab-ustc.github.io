<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will work on a compiler implementation
    project of your own choice. The goal is to have
    fun and explore more advanced compiler topics.
    You can work in a team of more than 3 students.
</p>
<p>
    We will grade you on how interesting your ideas are,
    how much you got working, how elegant your design
    is, how well you can explain it, and how creative your
    solution is. But remember that it is very easy to
    set up a grand project but make no
    progress at all, so try to make sure
    your goals are reasonable; perhaps the best you can do is to
    set a minimum goal that is
    definitely achievable and a more ambitious goal if things go well.
</p>

<h3>Sample Ideas</h3>
<p>
    Here are some ideas you may want to get started with---but,
    you are encouraged to pursue your own ideas.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Implement some language features, that are now missing
        from MiniJava, into your Tiger compiler (e.g.,
        exception handling, interface, nested classes, or
        reflections).
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement a fancier garbage collector for Tiger
        compiler, say, a generational collector.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement a new backend for your Tiger compiler
        targeting other ISAs (e.g., AArch64, RISC-V 64).
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement some kinds of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)">profiling</a>
        into your Tiger compiler.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement a code generator targeting Java byte code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design and implement an experimental
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">
            Java Virtual Machine</a> (JVM).
        The JVM you implement should
        support at least the bytecode instructions you will need in
        the Tiger compiler.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement some form of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">
            JIT</a> in the above JVM.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design and implement
        a backend targeting <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a>, so
        that your Tiger compiler can leverage the optimizations
        and backends of LLVM for free.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design and implement an
        <a href="https://rw4.cs.uni-saarland.de/~grund/papers/cc06-ra_ssa.pdf">
            SSA-based register allocation</a>
        for your Tiger compiler.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    Have fun!
