<h1>Lab 1: Lexer and Parser</h1>

<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this course, you will design and implement a
    compiler <em>Tiger</em>, for a non-trivial subset of
    the Java programming language MiniJava, as described in the
    appendix of the Tiger book.
    You will use Java as the implementation
    language (so you are following the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)">
        chicken and egg tradition</a> in compiler design community).
    By the end of this course, you will not only learn
    the theory and practice of compilers, but also gain a deeper
    understanding about Java.
</p>
<p>
    There are 7 labs and a final project planned:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lab 1: lexer and parser.
        Your will
        design and implement a front-end (i.e., a lexer and a parser) for Tiger.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 2: abstract syntax trees and type checker.
        You will design and implement an
        abstract syntax tree and build a type checker for it.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 3: control-flow graph.
        You will create a control-flow graph intermediate
        representation, and translate an abstract syntax tree
        to this representation.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 4: instruction selection.
        You will generate x64 assembly by implementing an instruction
        selector.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 5: register allocation.
        You will implement a register allocator, to allocate
        variables to physical registers.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 6: garbage collection.
        You will design and implement a garbage collector, and
        link it to your Tiger compiler.
    </li>
    <li>Lab 7: static single-assignment form.
        You will design and implement a static single-assignment form,
        and perform compiler optimizations on it.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Finally, there is a final project, in
    which you are required to propose your own ideas and to do some
    nontrivial projects.
</p>
<p>
    This is the lab 1. In this lab, you will implement a
    frond-end, i.e., a lexer and a parser, for Tiger.
</p>

<h3>Software Setup</h3>
<p>
    In this lab, you will use Java as your implementation language,
    please first check
    <a href="../../references.html" target="_blank">the reference page</a>
    to install necessary software, if you have not installed the
    Java platform.
    Make sure to install the latest
    Java compiler and runtime (<em>version 22</em>), other versions
    of Java do NOT work as the Tiger compiler makes use of some
    latest Java feature in version 22 (e.g., pattern matching or
    string templates).
    You can use any Java IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, or VS code).
</p>

<h3>Version control and Git</h3>
<p>
    In each lab, we will supply skeleton code for you to start with
    and modify. These files are controlled and distributed using the Git
    version control system. So, to access these files, you will first
    need a Git client installed on your machine. On Linux or Mac, it is
    easy to install a Git client:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linux:
        <pre>$ <kbd>sudo apt install git</kbd></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Mac:
        <pre>$ <kbd>brew install git</kbd></pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    On Windows, there are many
    Git clients available, among which
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">msysgit</a>
    is a very popular one, you can
    install and try it if you are using Windows.
</p>
<p>
    For those who have no prior experience of using Git, do not
    forget to refer to the
    <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">official manual</a>
    when in doubt.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    This year, we have put the skeleton code repository on
    GitHub (hence this courseware is open-source).
    To check out the code repository for lab 1 to your machine, you should
    run the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git clone https://github.com/bjhua/tiger.git</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will create a new folder <code>tiger</code> in
    which reside all the source files just checked out for the
    <em>lab 1</em> branch (the default branch).
</p>
<p>
    Git is a distributed version control system, allowing one to work with
    the local version of repository on your machine. For
    instance, if you have finished the exercise 5 in lab 1,
    you can commit your changes by:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab 1, exercise 5'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will commit the changes to your <em>local</em> repository.
</p>
<p>
    Now import the project into your favorite Java IDE and browse the
    source code:
</p>
<pre>
    src/Tiger.java:   the "Main" class serving as compiler entry
    src/lexer/*:      the lexer
    src/parser/*:     the parser
    src/control/*:    to control the behavior of the compiler
    src/util/*:       utility classes
    src/slp/*:        the SLP interpreter and compiler
    test/*:           MiniJava programs as testcases (so do not compile them as compiler sources)
</pre>
<p>
    Now, build this project on your machine. When the
    building process finished, a new <code>bin</code> folder
    would be created. Note that the name of the output folder
    depends on your specific IDE configurations.
    For example, the folder may be named <code>out</code> or
    something else. But we will always name it <code>bin</code>
    in the following and subsequent labs.
</p>
<p>
    If there are no building errors during the building process,
    you can run the <code>Tiger</code> compiler:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Tiger -help</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will output something like:
</p>
<pre class="output">
The Tiger compiler. Copyright (C) 2013-, SSE of USTC.
Usage: java Tiger [options] &lt;filename&gt;

Available options:
    -dump {token}   dump tokens from lexical analysis
    -help           show this help information
</pre>

<h3>Lab Requirement</h3>
<p>
    There are two kinds of exercises: normal exercises and
    challenge ones. Normal exercises are all required,
    whereas all challenge exercises are optional.
    Challenge exercises may not
    be that hard, but may involve substantial design
    efforts or code hacking.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished your lab, zip you solutions and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC online teaching system</a>.
</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Part A: SLP and Its Interpreter and Compiler</h2>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, you will do some programming exercises
    to warm you up. To be specific, you will write an interpreter
    and a compiler for a small programming language SLP, which stands
    for
    <u>S</u>traight-<u>L</u>ine <u>P</u>rogramming language.
    In other words, the SLP language has no control-flow constructs.
    The syntax
    for SLP is given in chapter 1 of the Tiger book. You should
    refer to the Tiger book for the syntax details.
</p>
<p>
    This part of the lab serves as an introduction to environments
    (symbol tables mapping variable names to information about
    the variables); to abstract syntax trees (data structures representing
    the syntactic structure of programs); to recursion over tree data
    structures which is useful in many parts of a compiler;
    and to a functional programming style without assignment
    statements.
</p>

<h3>SLP Abstract Syntax Trees</h3>
<p>
    SLP contains just two syntactic forms: statements
    and expressions.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the SLP syntax in the chapter 1 of the Tiger book, make
    sure you understand how an SLP program is formed.
    As a
    specific example, explain to yourself why the following program
    is legal according to SLP syntax:
    <pre class="code">
        a := 5+3;
        b := (print(a, a-1), 10*a);
        print(b)</pre>
    What is this program's output?
</div>

<p>
    The key idea of a compiler is to encode the language
    syntax with tree-like data structures. We will delve into this
    topic in lab 2. For the purpose of this lab, we have offered
    you some Java classes encoding the SLP syntax.
    To be specific, Java (since version 14) has introduced a nice
    feature called
    <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/395">record</a>
    to encode an aggregated
    data structure, which is amenable for compiler implementation.
    Technically speaking, a Java record is similar to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">algebraic datatypes</a>
    from functional programming.
</p>
<p>
    To put the above discussion into perspective, let us consider
    the following sample grammar:
</p>
<pre>
    T ::= B1 | B2 | ... | Bn
</pre>
<p>
    to encode this grammar using Java record, we can declare a sealed
    interface for
    the left non-terminal <code class="name">T</code>, and n records
    <code class="name">B1</code> to
    <code>Bn</code> for the n right-hands,
    respectively, all implementing the interface <code>T</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
    interface sealed T permits B1, B2, ..., Bn {}
    record B1(...) implements T{...}
    record B2(...) implements T{...}
    ...
    record Bn(...) implements T{...}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Such data structures are normally called abstract
    syntax trees, which we will discuss in depth in lab 2.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Read the class definitions in <code>src/slp/Slp.java</code>, make
    sure you understand how these classes define the
    SLP syntax. As a
    concrete example, make sure you understand how
    the object <code>sample1</code>
    in the source file <code>src/slp/SamplesPrograms.java</code> encodes the
    SLP program in exercise 1.
    You do not need to write any code for this exercise.
</div>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    For this SLP program:
    <pre class="code">
        a := 1;
        b := 0;
        print(a/b)</pre>
    Use the data structures for SLP, to define a new program
    <code>sample2</code>
    in the source file <code>src/slp/SamplesPrograms.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Pretty Printer</h3>
<p>
    In compiler design, we often need to dump the
    internal data structures to inspect the status
    of these structures. Such inspections can not only
    aid debugging the compiler, but also guarantee the implementation
    correctness.
    A well-established technique finish this task is called
    <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint">pretty printing</a></em>,
    which is also a classical algorithmic implementation topic.
</p>
<p>
    The implementation of pretty printing, as well as implementation
    of similar operations
    on compiler's data structures (e.g., abstract syntax trees),
    is highly dependent on the implementation
    languages. To be specific, for the Java language as we used in this course,
    the standard way to accomplish this task is to use a special
    design pattern called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitor pattern</a>.
    You should refer to the chapter 4 of the Tiger
    book for an excellent introduction to the visitor
    pattern and especially it usages in compilers.
    And you may also refer to books on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design pattern</a>
    to understand how visitor pattern works in general.
    Furthermore, it should also be noted that design patterns are
    important for other object-oriented language (e.g., C++, or Python),
    besides Java.
</p>
<p>
    While design patterns are well-understood and established techniques
    to implement operations on data structures in an object-oriented
    style, we will use
    <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/406">pattern matching</a>,
    another novel feature from Java (since version 17),
    to implement these operations in a functional programming style,
    which is much easier to write and understand than visitor patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the aforementioned sample grammar, we can define
    an operation <code>op</code> on the type <code>T</code>
    as the following node demonstrated:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
        void op(T x){
            switch(x){
                case B1(...) -> {...}
                case B2(...) -> {...}
                ...
                case Bn(...) -> {...}
            }
        }</code></pre>
<p>
    this code is essentially a case analysis, which
    inspects all possible shapes of the type <code>T</code>
    and perform actions based on the shape, respectively.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Read the code in <code>src/slp/PrettyPrint.java</code>, make
    sure you understand how this code implement the pretty
    printing through
    pattern matching.
    Then run the code <code>src/slp/Main.java</code>:
    <pre>
        $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin slp.Main</kbd></pre>
    to pretty print the sample programs.
    The output looks like:
    <pre class="output">
        a = 5+3;
        b = (print(a, a-1, ), 10*a);
        print(b, )</pre>
    As you may notice, there is a "bug" in the implementation of
    printing the <code>print</code> statement: it will always
    print a redundant <code>,</code> at the end of the argument list.
    For example, it will print
    <code>print(a, b, )</code> for a print statement with two
    arguments, instead of <code>print(a, b)</code>.
    Fix this bug.
</div>

<h3>Maximum Argument Numbers</h3>
<p>
    A program may contain zero, or more <code>print</code>
    statements, each of which taking one or more arguments (that is,
    the <code>print</code> function is overloaded).
    For instance, the
    above SLP program in exercise 1 has two <code>print</code>
    statements: the
    former one has 2 arguments whereas the latter one has just 1.
    We define the maximum argument numbers of program as
    the maximum number of arguments among all <code>print</code> statements.
    For example, the maximum argument number for the above program
    is 2.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Finish the code in <code>src/slp/MaxArgument.java</code>,
    to calculate the maximum
    number of arguments with a
    given program.
    Do not forget to test your code when finished, and
    fix any bugs before continuing.
</div>

<h3>An Interpreter</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you will write an interpreter for SLP.
    An interpreter runs a given program
    online, that is, it analyzes the program and mimic the
    execution behaviour of the program.
    As SLP
    has an assignment statement <code>x:=e</code>, so
    the interpreter must have an abstract memory, which keeps
    track of the current value of a variable <code>x</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Finish the Java code in<code>src/slp/Interpreter.java</code>
    that "interprets" a program in SLP.
    You may need to modify the types of the corresponding methods.
    Do not forget to test your code when finished, and
    fix any bugs before continuing.
    For example, if we run the above sample SLP program in exercise 1,
    <pre>
        $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin slp.Main</kbd></pre>
    which should output:
    <pre class="output">
        8 7
        80</pre>
    note that the number <code>7</code> is followed by a
    newline character.
</div>


<h3>A Compiler from SLP to x64</h3>
<p>
    In this part, you will be building a compiler for SLP targeting
    x64. Do not worry, if you are not familiar with x64, as
    we will not make use too much complex features of it.
    And also we will discuss x64 in details in lab 5.
    You may want to refer to some
    <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/resources/x86-64-reference.pdf">
        instruction set manual</a>
    to familiarize yourself with x64.
    You may also want to take a look at the
    <a href="https://www.ired.team/miscellaneous-reversing-forensics/windows-kernel-internals/linux-x64-calling-convention-stack-frame">x64
        calling conventions</a>, to understand how a function
    call happens.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    First read the code
    in <code>src/slp/Compiler.java</code>,
    to understand how an SLP
    program is compiled to x64 assembly.
    Your job is to extend the compiler to support the subtraction
    <code>-</code> and the division <code>/</code>.
    Do not forget to test your compiler using the test cases in
    <code>src/slp/SampleProgram.java</code>, as well as your own
    test cases.
</div>


<!-- part B -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: The Lexer</h2>
<p>
    A lexer reads as input the program source files and outputs
    a series of tokens recognized. In this part of the lab,
    you will design and implement a lexer for Tiger.
</p>
<p>
    The first step to design and
    implement the lexer is to design good data structures
    to represent the input and output, respectively,
    which is, nevertheless to say,
    implementation language dependent.
    In Java, we can represent the
    input by some kind of (buffered) input
    stream established from the program source text file, and can
    represent recognized
    token by specific data structure.
    The data structure defining token can be found in
    the class <code>src/lexer/Token.java</code>. This
    data structure consists of the following key fields:
<ul>
    <li><code>kind</code>: the kind of the token, which is an
        enumerable type
        as defined by <code>enum Kind</code>;
    </li>
    <li><code>lexeme</code>: extra information that the
        token may carry, if any; and
    </li>
    <li><code>rowNum, colNum</code>: the positions of the token in the
        source program (this
        information is crucial in later phase of the compiler, such as
        error diagnosing and profiling).
        For simplicity, we just
        use row and column numbers to represent current
        token's position.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    You should read the MiniJava specification carefully, and
    determine what other tokens should be added by
    extending the <code>enum Kind</code> type.
</div>

<p>
    To implement the lexer algorithm, we have two options: the
    handwritten approach and the automatic
    lexer generator approach. Both are very popular in
    compiler implementations. In this lab, we will use a handwritten
    approach to implement the lexer for Tiger, which is also
    used by production compilers such as GCC or LLVM.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
    The method <code>nextToken0()</code> in the file
    <code>lexer/Lexer.java</code> recognize tokens.
    Read the MiniJava specification and supply
    the missing code for the method.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, you have finished the lexer, and your Tiger
    compiler should compile <em>all</em> the test programs in
    the <code>/test</code> directory. Before you continue,
    you should run your Tiger compiler on
    these test cases and make sure your lexer works correctly.
    For instance, to test your compiler on the input file
    <code>/test/Factorial.java</code>):
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>java --enable-preview -cp bin Tiger ./test/Factorial.java -dump token</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    which will not only lex your test case but also will dump
    the tokens recognized.
    If your compiler fails on any test cases, check your code to
    fix bugs and re-test your compiler. And you may want to
    write more test cases to test your Tiger compiler besides
    the test cases we offered.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
    Your lexer must be fast enough to lex (reasonably) large Java
    programs. To test how fast your lexer is, you should
    use some relatively large Java test cases.
    Download this
    <a href="MonsterGen.java">monster generator</a>
    and compile it:
    <pre>
  $ <kbd>javac MonsterGen.java</kbd>
</pre>
    then run it to produce a <code>Monster.java</code> code:
    <pre>
  $ <kbd>java MonsterGen 100000>Monster.java</kbd>
</pre>
    And run your lexer on <code>Monster.java</code> to determin how
    long it will take to compile this program?
    How long does Oracle's <code>javac</code> compiler take
    compile it?
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    We have used a row number <code>rowNum</code> and a column
    number <code>colNum</code> to represent the position of a token.
    Though simple and easy to implement, such position information is
    coarse-grained in that they only record where a
    token starts, but not where it ends.
    Propose a better data
    structure to represent a position in a fine-grained manner
    and implement your idea into the compiler.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    Modify your lexer to lex full Java, instead of MiniJava. After
    you finish this, you can use your lexer to lex some
    nontrivial Java projects, such as the
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">Apache's source
        code</a>.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    Use an automatic lexer generator to build your Tiger lexer.
    For example, you
    may try the <a href="https://jflex.de/">JFlex</a>, a very
    popular lexical analyzer generator. Is this approach better
    than the handwritten approach we have used in this lab?
</div>

<!-- part C -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part C: The Parser</h2>
<p>
    You will implement a parser in this part of the lab.
    A parser parses the input program, according
    to the given language syntax, and determines
    whether the target program is legal.
    The parser generates data structures to be processed
    by later phases, if the target program is legal.
</p>
<p>
    Just as for the lexer, there are generally two approaches to
    implement a parser: handwritten or using an automatic
    parser generator. We will implement a handwritten recursive
    descendent parser in this part, that is, all production rules become
    a bunch of recursive functions with (approximately) one
    function for one non-terminal.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
    Finish the recursive decedent parser in the
    file <code>parser/Parser.java</code>. We have offered most
    code for you, you should supply the missing code for
    those incomplete methods.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, your parser should be able to parse all
    MiniJava programs. Remember
    to test your parser thoroughly using
    the test cases in directory <code>/test</code> as well as your
    own test cases. Fix any bugs before continuing.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
    The current implementation of the error handling and
    error recovery method <code>error()</code>
    only reports an error message before exiting.
    Modify this method to report more accurate error messages, such
    as the file name, the line number, the column
    number, some diagnostic
    message, and the related source code. You may take a look
    at the diagnostic messages generated by the
    <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">Clang
        compiler</a> to get some idea.
    Finally, you may
    try to implement error recover, that
    is, to recover from errors so that all potential syntactic errors
    can be detected.

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge!</span>
    Implement your parser with automatic parser generators.
    For instance, you may use
    <a href="https://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/">CUP</a>, or
    <a href="https://www.antlr.org/index.html">AntLR</a>, or
    <a href="https://sablecc.org/">SableCC</a>, etc.
    Again, this exercise may not be that difficult, but may require
    considerable modifications to current code base and
    programming efforts.
