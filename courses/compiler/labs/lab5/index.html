<h1>Lab 5: Register Allocation</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will design and implement a register allocator
    for your <code>Tiger</code> compiler, to allocate variables
    to physical registers.
</p>
<p>
    This lab consists of two parts: first, in part A, you
    will design and implement a baseline allocator to allocate
    variables to stack frames.
    In part B, you will implement linear scan register
    allocator.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
    First check out the source code we offered you for lab 5:
</p>
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab4'</kbd>
    $ <kbd>git checkout -b lab5 origin/lab5</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    these commands will first commit your changes to the lab4
    branch of your local Git repository, and then create a
    local lab5 branch and check out the remote lab5 branch
    into the new local lab5 branch.
</p>
<p>
    Again, you will need to merge your code from lab4 into the
    new lab5 branch:
<pre>
    $ <kbd>git merge lab4</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    Do not forget to resolve any conflicts before commiting to
    the local lab5 branch:
</p>

<pre>
    $ <kbd>git commit -am 'lab5 init'</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
    You should first import the new lab5 code into
    your editor, and make sure the code compiles. There
    are a bunch of new files that you
    should browse through:
</p>
<pre>
    regalloc/*:    register allocators
</pre>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished this lab, zip you code and submit to the
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn">online teaching system</a>.
</p>

<hr/>
<!-- part A -->
<h2>Part A: A Stack Allocator</h2>
<p>
    We start by building a baseline stack register allocator, to allocate
    all variables to stack frames instead of physical registers
    (i.e., all variables are spilled).
    While this allocator generates inefficient code with
    many memory load/stores, it is easier
    to implement and serves as the baseline allocator in most production
    compilers (i.e., the <code>-O0</code> optimization level).
</p>

<h3>Temp Maps</h3>
<p>
    As we are allocating variables to stack slots in a stack
    frame, it is essential to keep track of where each variable
    has been allocated to. We use a data structure <code>TempMap</code>
    to record the stack frame offset for each variable.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
    Read the code in <code>regalloc/TempMap.java</code>, to
    understand the data structure.
    It should be noted that while this data structure
    allows two options for allocation: <code>InReg</code>
    and <code>InStack</code>, we only use <code>InStack</code>
    in this part of the lab.
</div>

<h3>Function Frames</h3>
<p>
    The frame data structure keeps track of
    how many slots have been allocated for a given function.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
    Read the frame data structure in <code>regalloc/Frame.java</code>,
    to understand the implementation of a frame.
    You do not need to write any code for this exercise.
</div>

<h3>Stack Allocation</h3>
<p>
    With these data structures, we can allocate variables.
    The allocation consists of three major steps:
    1) allocating stack slots for variables (i.e., arguments and locals)
    in a given function;
    2) rewriting each assembly instruction by inserting
    necessary load/stores of the
    variables from/to the stack frame; and
    3) adding necessary function prologue and epilogue to
    adjust the function frame when entering and exiting the
    function.
</p>
<p>
    The second step deserves more explanation. The instruction
    rewriting is syntax-directed by adding loads before each
    instruction and stores after it.
    Take a binary operation instruction as an example
    (for simplicity, we write instruction in TAC form
    instead of in assembly form without losing generality):
</p>
<pre><code>x = y + z; // uses = [y, z], defs = [x]</code></pre>
<p>
    suppose the stack slot allocated for <code>x</code>,
    <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> are <code>l_x</code>,
    <code>l_y</code>, and <code>l_z</code>, respectively. Then
    the above instruction will be translated to:
</p>
<pre class="code">r1 = M[l_y];
r2 = M[l_z];
r1 = r1 + r2;
M[l_x] = r1;</pre>
<p>
    which used 2 scratch registers <code>r1</code> and
    <code>r2</code>, where <code>r1</code> is reused to hold
    both the use <code>y</code> and the def <code>x</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
    Finish the code in <code>StackAllocator.java</code>,
    to allocate variables to physical registers.
    You may also need to extend or modify
    the pretty printer in <code>regalloc/PpAssem.java</code>.
</div>

<h3>Prologue and Epilogue</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue_and_epilogue">
    function prologue</a> is a fragment of assembly code
    at the beginning of
    a function, which prepare the call stack and registers for
    use within the function. Similarly, a function epilogue
    appears at the end of the function, and restores the stack
    and registers to the state they were in before the function
    was called.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
    Implement function prologue and epilogue for Tiger.
    You can treat the size of the function frame as 0
    (which will be determined by the register allocator
    in the next lab).
    To keep things simple, you can save all callee-saved
    registers in the prologue and restore them in the epilogue,
    regardless of whether the variable is used in the callee.
    Furthermore, your Tiger compiler can always reserve <code>%rbp</code>
    as the stack frame base pointer.
</div>

<h3>A Runtime</h3>
<p>
    To generate complete executables, we need link the Tiger-produced
    assembly against a runtime.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
    Read the file <code>src/runtime/runtime.c</code>
    for the code of the runtime.
    Modify and extend this code to add other runtime functions
    that your Tiger-produced assembly can invoke.
    Specifically, you may use any strategy you think appropriate
    to implement memory allocations. In the next lab, you will
    design and implement a garbage collector to manage the
    Java heap.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler can compile <em>any</em>
    MiniJava programs to produce assembly.
    Furthermore, when linked against the above runtime,
    your Tiger compiler can produce final executables which, when
    executed,
    should produce <em>correct</em> result.
    Do not forget to test your Tiger compiler, fix any potential
    bugs before continuing.
</p>

<!-- part b: linear scan -->
<hr/>
<h2>Part B: A Linear Scan Allocator</h2>
<p>
    In this part, you will design and implement a linear scan
    register allocator, as described in
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/330249.330250">this paper</a>.
    Your should first read this paper carefully to understand the
    algorithm, <em>before</em> writing any code.
</p>

<h3>Liveness Analysis</h3>
<p>
    You will first write a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness_analysis">liveness analysis</a>
    to calculate, for each instruction
    and transfer in a function, the live-in and live-out variable sets.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
    Write a liveness analysis for Tiger, to calculate live-in
    and live-out information.
    We are free to
    propose any data structures and algorithms to
    calculate this liveness information.
    To keep things simple, you can write
    the analysis on a single instruction granularity, to use
    the following dataflow equation:
    <pre><code>live_in[s]  = uses[s] &cup; (live_out[s] - defs[s])
live_out[s] = &cup;(live_in[p])                     // for any p &in; succ[s];</code></pre>
    with all live_in[] and live_out[] initialized to an empty set &emptyset;.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    Most dataflow analysis should follow an order of
    the flow of data. For liveness analysis, the caculation
    should be backward from the last instruction in a
    function to the first one.
    Implement this strategy to speed up your analysis.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    To speed up the liveness analysis, you may
    calculate liveness information on a block granularity
    instead of on an instruction granularity.
    That is, you can use the following dataflow equation:
    <pre><code>live_in[b]  = uses[b] &cup; (live_out[b] - defs[b])
live_out[b] = &cup;(live_in[p])                     // for any p &in; succ[b];</code></pre>
    where the live variable set uses[] and defs[]
    for each block <code>b</code> is calculated by a one-pass backward
    iteration of all statements in this block.
    Implement this strategy to speed up your liveness analysis.
</div>

<h3>Topological Sorting and Live Intervals</h3>
<p>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">
    topological sorting</a>
    linearizes the basic blocks in a control-flow
    graph, so that each basic block <code>b</code> (hence
    each instruction or transfer
    in that block) will have a unique linear order number <code>n</code>
    with total order.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
    Implement topological sorting of basic blocks
    to linearize them. It should be noted that, generally
    speaking, a control-flow graph might not have a strict
    topological sorting due to the existence of loops.
    Hence, your algorithm will really produce a quasi-topological order.
</div>
<p>
    Given a specific topological order, we can calculate, for each
    variable <code>x</code>, its live interval <code>[low, high]</code>.
    Intuitively, the variable <code>x</code> is "always" live in this
    interval, hence requiring a unique
    physical register <code>r</code> to hold its value.
</p>
<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
    Calculate, for each variable <code>x</code>, its live interval
    <code>[low, high]</code>. Think carefully about the underlying data
    structure designs.
</div>

<h3>Allocation</h3>
<p>
    Variables can be allocated to registers by a linear scan
    of all live intervals. Live intervals <code>[low, high]</code>
    should be increasingly ordered according to its left coordinate
    <code>low</code>.
</p>

<div class="required">
    <span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
    Allocate variables to physical registers by implementing
    the linear scan algorithm.
    Rewrite the assembly instructions according to the allocation
    result.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler can compile <em>any</em>
    MiniJava programs without spilling to assembly.
    Furthermore, when linked against the above runtime,
    your Tiger compiler can produce final executables which, when
    executed,
    should produce <em>correct</em> result.
    Do not forget to test your Tiger compiler, fix any potential
    bugs before continuing.
</p>

<h3>Spilling</h3>
<p>
    Variables that cannot be allocated to registers should be
    spilled to stack frames. Extra load/stores should be added
    for the spilled variables.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    Implement spilling, so that your Tiger compiler can
    compile programs with arbitrary variable interferences.
</div>

<p>
    After implementing spilling, your Tiger compiler can compile <em>any</em>
    MiniJava programs to produce assembly.
    Test your Tiger compiler before continuing.
</p>


<h3>Coalescing</h3>
<p>
    Coalescing is an optimization to remove
    move instructions where the source and target are the same.
    Specifically, for move instruction
</p>
<pre class="code">movq %x, %y     // %y = %x</pre>
<p>
    if both variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can be
    allocated to the same physical register (say <code>%r</code>), then
    the resulting move instruction:
</p>
<pre class="code">movq %r, %r</pre>
<p>
    is essentially a <code>nop</code>, hence can be removed subsequently.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <span class="header">Challenge.</span>
    Implement coalescing, so that your Tiger compiler can
    eliminate practically <code>all</code> move instructions from
    the programs being compiled.
</div>

<p>
    To this point, your Tiger compiler should compile <em>any</em>
    MiniJava programs by allocating variables to registers.
    Do not forget to test your Tiger compiler and fix potential bugs.
