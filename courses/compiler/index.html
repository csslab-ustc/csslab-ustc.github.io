        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This course teaches the principle of design and implementation
            of programming languages. This year, we will concentrate on
            language implementation, that is, compiler
            theory and engineering. You will study, in detail, core
            components of modern compilers, including: lexical
            analysis, parsing, abstract syntax trees, type
            checking, memory management, intermediate representation, code
            generation, optimization, and garbage collection, etc.
            Most importantly, you will study the interactions
            between theory and practice by implementing a nontrivial compiler for a
            subset of the Java programing language.
            You will gain a deep
            understanding of how to manage the complexity
            introduced by the interactions in a complex software system like
            compiler.
