      <h1>Lab 3: Privilege Separation</h1>
      <hr>

      <h3>Lab Overview</h3>
In this lab, you'll explore privilege separation. The
key insight of privilege separation is to give minimal
privilege to each component of a system, so that when
one component of the system is comprised, other components
will not be comprised too. 

<p>
To make the discussion
concrete, you will do this lab for the Touchstone web 
server, that is, you will privilege-separate the Touchstone
web server by giving each component appropriate
privilege. To be specific, you will first examine possible bugs
in the source code of the Touchstone web server, and comprise
the Touchstone web server by designing and performing
exploitations. Finally, you will
break up the application into privilege-separated components
to minimize the effects of possible vulnerabilities.

<p>
This lab consists of three parts:
<ul>
  <li>Part A: you will examine the architecture of the Touchstone
    web server. The Touchstone web server in this lab differs dramatically
    from those from lab 1 and 2, the current one is based on
    the idea of <i>services</i>;
  </li>
  <li>Part B: you will explore <i>jail</i>, by which you
    can constraint the service in some fake root directory; and
  </li>  
  <li>Part C: you will privilege-separate the Touchstone
    web server by assigning each component appropriate
    privilege.
  </li> 
</ul>

<h3>Lab Environment</h3>
Download <a href="lab3-code.rar">lab 3 code</a>
 to start with. In order to bind to the port 80 (the
default HTTP port), you will start the
<code>touchstone</code> web server with the root
privilege in this lab (in Linux, only
root-privilege process can bind to port less than 1024):
<pre>
      $ <kbd>make</kbd>
      $ <kbd>sudo ./touchstone</kbd> 
        Password: (enter seed password)
</pre>
Open your browser and go to this URL
<code>http://127.0.0.1</code>, you will get a web page. Contact
us, if you do not get this page.

<p>
In this lab, you will disable ASLR:
<pre>
      $ <kbd>su root</kbd>
        Password: (enter root password)
      # <kbd>sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0</kbd>
</pre>
which will make your exploitations easier. However, keep in kind
that it's also possible to compromise the application
when ASLR and other protections are on, just as you did
in lab 2.

<h1>Part A: The Touchstone Web Server</h1>
To help you finish this lab, let's first examine the
architecture and source code of the Touchstone web
server, which differs from the ones that you've
seen in previous labs.

<p>
The overall design and architecture
of the Touchstone web server is described in the following
figure. The server consists of three main components: the
server (<code>server</code>), the HTTP request dispatcher
(<code>httpd</code>), and one or more
services (<code>Filesv, Banksv</code>, etc..).

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="./2.jpg" height="300px">
</div>

<p>
The server launches the HTTP dispatcher
<code>httpd</code>, and two services: the
<code>filesv</code> and the <code>banksv</code> (indicated
by the solid black arrows). The server
accepts incoming connections on the 80 port (the upper
grey arrow), and routes
the request to the HTTP dispatcher (the dotted grey
arrow). The HTTP dispatcher reads
the request line from the coming socket (the first line)
and decides which kind the request belongs to. Generally speaking, a 
web server will accept static and dynamic requests. To
illustrate this, the Touchstone web server consists of
two sample services to serve static web pages and dynamic bank
services, which models a typical web-based electronic bank. Nevertheless
to say, a production
web server will likely to contain more kinds of services.

<p>
Next, the dispatcher will route the requests to the
corresponding service. The service continues to read
the HTTP headers and the body (if any), and respond
appropriately. Now, the Touchstone is up.

<p>
The main design consideration for the current architecture
is to simplify design and to increase throughout. By
routing different request into different service, each
service can be kept as simple as possible and be
implemented without too much difficulty. By using a
multi-process architecture, requests can be processed
concurrently and high throughout can be achieved (hopefully).

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
In order to gain deeper understanding of the internal
architecture of the Touchstone web server, let's
use gdb to debug the <code>banksv</code> service.

<p>
First, launch the server:
<pre>
  $<kbd> sudo ./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
now use gdb to attach to the <code>banksv</code> service:
<pre>
  $<kbd> ps -a</kbd>
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  24356 pts/0    00:00:00 touchstone
  24357 pts/0    00:00:00 filesv
  24358 pts/0    00:00:00 banksv
  24359 pts/0    00:00:00 httpd
  $<kbd> sudo gdb </kbd>
  Password: (enter seed password)
  (gdb) <kbd>attach 24358</kbd>
  Attaching to process 24358
  (gdb) <kbd>b Handle_post</kbd> 
  Breakpoint 1 at 0x80d0d9f: file handle.c, line 28.
  (gdb) <kbd>set follow-fork-mode child</kbd>
</pre>
this will set a break point on the function <code>Handle_post</code>.
Now open your browser and visit the URL <code>127.0.0.1</code>, 
click the <code>Register</code> (or the <code>Login</code>) button, 
a POST http request will be sent to the Touchstone (as indicated
by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29">
FORM</a>), and the above break point will be hit. Now let's
continue the execution:
<pre>
  (gdb) <kbd>c</kbd>
  Continuing. (waiting user for clicking register or login button from index.html)
  
  [New process 25533]
  [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
  
  Breakpoint 1, Handle_post (uri=0xbf951084 "/", fd=6) at handle.c:74
  74        char *info = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n";
</pre>
And then single-step the source code, examine carefully
where the user input goes: 
<pre>
  (gdb) <kbd>n</kbd>
  75        Body_t *b = getBody(&num);
  (gdb) <kbd>n</kbd>
  77        char *name = b[0]->value;
  (gdb) <kbd>n</kbd>
  78        char *pwd  = b[1]->value;
  (gdb) <kbd>n</kbd>
  80        char *type = b[num-1]->value;
  (gdb) <kbd>p name</kbd>
   $3 = 0x90ca4b8 "sa12"   <kbd><----login user name</kbd>
  (gdb) <kbd>p pwd</kbd>
   $4 = 0x90ca6c0 "1234"   <kbd><----login user password</kbd>
  (gdb) <kbd>p type</kbd>
   $6 = 0x90ca8c8 "Login"  <kbd><----Post Request type</kbd>
</pre>
Next, the user input will be be fed into the database:
<pre>
  (gdb) <kbd>n</kbd>
   82        init_db();
  (gdb) <kbd>s</kbd>               
   init_db () at ./sql_lite3/sqlhelper.c:32
   32        if(open_db()==SUCCESS){
   .....
</pre>
</div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Finally, you will write some code. 
Extend the current sqlite3 user table, to add more
information. For instance, you can add time and IP
address to the user table, so that when one user has
logged in, the web page can display the last login
time, the current login address, etc.. You may want to read
some <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/skywalker256/article/

<h1>Part B: Jail and Jail Breaking</h1>
In this part, we will discuss jail and jail breaking. Jail is
a special form of sandbox, which provides a restricted
environment to run programs that are not completely
trustworthy. For example, if the program is 
downloaded from an untrusted source, running the
program in an unrestricted environment can expose the
system to potential risks. If these programs 
can be executed in a restricted environment, even if
the programs behave maliciously (the programs might
contain malicious contents or they might 
be compromised by attackers during the execution), their
damage is confined within the restricted environment.

<h3>Jail</h3>
Recall that in order to bind to the port 80, the server, along
with the dispatcher and the services, run with the root
privilege. However, this may incur serious security
vulnerabilities. To make the discussion concrete, let's
try to steal some some important
or sensitive files from the Touchstone host.

<p>
The <code>filesv</code> service is responsible for the
HTTP's GET method, which will (basically) reads a local
file and responds to the client. Normal HTTP request
is supposed to access only those files stored in the web 
server, say, <code>index.html</code>. However, an adversary
can visit any file in the file system, with the root privilege.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Modify the code snippet
in the <code>browser.c</code> to send a constructed HTTP request to
the web server to visit <code>/etc/passwd</code> file. That is, you
can read that file remotely, as follows.
<pre>
  $<kbd> ./browser 80</kbd>
  sock_client = 3
  Response = HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh
  ......
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To defeat this kind of attack, one can use the the basic
idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">choot</a> 
to isolate code that has potential security vulnerabilities.

<p>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span> 
Add some code to the <code>server.c</code> to add
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/linux/l-cn-chroot/">chroot</a>
support. Change root directory from <code>/</code> to
<code>/jail</code> . After this, you can compile and run 
the new web server:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>cd server</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make </kbd>
  $ <kbd>sudo ./chroot-setup.sh</kbd>
   + grep -qv uid=0
   + id 
   + rm -rf /jail
   + mkdir -p /jail
   + cp -p index.html /jail
   + ./chroot-copy.sh touchstone /jail
   + ./chroot-copy.sh httpd /jail
   ...
  $ <kbd>cd /jail</kbd>
  $ <kbd>sudo ./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
Now re-do exercise 3 to visit the file
<code>/etc/passwd</code>. If your chroot protection
works, your browser will behave like this (leaking
no sensitive information):
<pre>
  $ <kbd>./browser 80</kbd>
  sock_client = 3
  Response = HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  <html><b>File does not exist!</b></html>
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Jail Breaking</h3>
The basic idea of jail is to confine each process into
its own (fake) root directory, however, this is not
true for root-privileged processes. If a root-privileged
process is comprised, the process may escape from the
jail, this is called 
<a href="http://www.bpfh.net/computing/docs/chroot-break.html"> 
jail breaking</a>. Unfortunately, this is pretty true
for the Touchstone web server: all process are root-privileged
by default, so it's possible for these process to break
the jail, once they are comprised.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Perform the buffer-overflow attack, as you did in the lab 1, 
inject shell code into the server and execute. The primary
task of the shell code is to break the jail. And then read
or unlink the file </code>/etc/passwd</code>. 
</div>


<h1>Part C: Privilege Separation</h1>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation"
target="_blank">Privilege separation</a>
is a technique to divide a program into small parts which are 
limited to the specific privileges they require in order
to finish a specific task. This is used to mitigate the
potential damage of a computer security attack.

<p>
Two aspects make privilege separation challenging in the real world 
and in this lab. First, privilege separation requires that you take 
apart the application and split it up in separate pieces. Although 
it is relatively easy to split the Touchstone web application, spliting
real-world applications may be very difficult, if not
impossible. And it's very common that you must redesign certain parts to 
make privilege separation possible. 

<p>
Second, you must ensure that 
each piece runs with minimal privileges, which requires setting 
permissions precisely and configuring the pieces correctly. Hopefully, 
by the end of this lab, you'll have a better understanding of why many 
applications have security vulnerabilities related to failure to properly 
separate privileges: proper privilege separation is hard! 

<p>
Having surveyed the structure of Touchstone and acquired the base 
knowledge about jail, now let's start to think about how 
to apply privilege separation to the infrastructure of Touchstone, 
so that bugs in one component won't allow an adversary to 
comprise the whole system.

<h3>Privilege-separate the web server setup using Unix principals 
and permissions</h3>
As introduced in <code>Part A</code>, Touchstone consists of three
parts: the <code>httpd(dispatcher)</code>, the <code>filesv</code>
service and the <code>banksv</code> service. The
 <code>httpd</code> dispatcher routes requests to corresponding 
services. As the <code>httpd</code> daemon runs
with root privilege, so it can 

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Modify your browser code to inject some shell code 
the server. Your shell code attack the <code>httpd</code>
daemon and unlink the file <code>/db/users.db</code>. Using
ret-to-libc attack can make this a little simpler.
</div>

<p>
The reason for this problem is that Touchstone violates one
basic security principal: least privilege.
Different process should not delete some files belonging
to another process: the dynamic services should not
unlink static 
files that the server is serving. Conversely, the static service 
should not touch the databases. Here, you can see the
reason why the Touchstone web server is splited
into different services.

<p>
To mitigate this problem, you
should run the dispatcher and these services under
unprivileged users rather than root. Also, you should
set up appropriate permissions for files and
databases.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
Modify the function in the file <code>server.c</code> , to set up
the user and group IDs properly when services are launched.
Think carefully about how your code can set 
the user and group IDs by
<code>setresuid()、setgroups()、setresgid()</code>.

<p>
Set file and directory permissions to ensure that the 
static service cannot read the database files from the
dynamic service, and vice versa. Try to modify
the <code>chroot-setup.sh</code> to set the permission for
different files.
</div>


<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Compile the new Touchstone web server:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>make </kbd>
  $ <kbd>sudo ./chroot-setup.sh</kbd>
   + grep -qv uid=0
   + id 
   + rm -rf /jail
   + mkdir -p /jail
   + cp -p index.html /jail
   + ./chroot-copy.sh touchstone /jail
   + ./chroot-copy.sh httpd /jail
   ...
  $ <kbd>cd /jail</kbd>
  $ <kbd>sudo ./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
try to perform buffer overflow attack against the web serve.
Can you trick the web server into mis-behaving? Is it
exploitable?
</div>
 
<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Perform buffer overflow attack on the Touchstone web server. Can
you succeed? If yes, how? 
</div>

This completes the lab. Remember to hand in your solution to 
the information system.
