      <h1>Lab 4: Authentication</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <h3>Lab Overview</h3>
In this lab, you'll explore authentication. The key problem
that authentication addresses is that how to identify the
identity of a user. Think online banking system, on which
many users are registered. When some user A is transferring
money from her account into another user B's account, how
does the online banking system know whether this is the
real user A, but not some other (malicious) user C who is in the
disguise of A. At first glance, this problem is trivial, 
for the server can ask the user to input password and check
the password to guarantee that this is the correct user, however,  
the problem will get complicated by the fact that the network
packet can be sniffed.

<p>
To make the discussion concrete, you will do this lab for a
new version Touchstone web server. The new server contains
a very simple online banking system. Any user can transfer some money
into another user's account. However, this server contains
severe bugs, which presents the fact that without correct and reliable
authentication, a malicious user M can transfer money from
any user account into her own account. Next, you'll try
to implement some form of more strong authentication
system to enhance the server: say, you can add cookies to
your server, or you can use some encrypt algorithms to protect
sensitive data during data transmission over network.

<p>
In a summary, this lab is open-ended, and you can abuse
you freedom to present your own design and implement them.
Nevertheless to say, the bottom line is that you can 
guarantee that your solution is feasible.

<p>
This lab consists of three parts:
<ul>
  <li>Part A: you will explore identity forgery, in which 
    a malicious user can act as a victim user;
  </li>
  <li>Part B: you will explore the possibility of information
    disclosure during network transmission; and 
  </li>  
  <li>Part C: you will secure the server by designing
    some cryptography algorithm and adding them to your server.
  </li> 
</ul>

<h3>Lab Environment</h3>
Download <a href="lab4-code.rar">lab 4 code</a>
to start with. Build and run the Touchstone server:
<pre>
      $ <kbd>make</kbd>
</pre>
Open your browser and go to this URL
<code>http://127.0.0.1</code>, you will get a web page. Contact
us, if you do not get this page.

<h1>Part A: Identity Forgery</h1>
There is a new service in the Touchstone web server: the
transfer service. You can first register an account in the
server and log in. You can now find the account page which
will present the transferring interface, along with user
name, login time, among other things.

<h3>Bugs in the Transfer Service</h3>
The utility here is that some account (after logging) can
transfer money from her own account to another account, just
like the real bank business. Read the server's source
code: <code>handle.c</code>, and familiarize yourself
with the code that the server is executing, when
one account is transferring. (Pay special attention
to the functions <code>handlePost()</code> and
<code>handlePostTransfer()</code>.)

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
There are many bugs and vulnerabilities in the current
utility for transferring money. Find as many bugs as you can. For now, just 
focus on bugs that an adversary can trigger by giving unanticipated 
values to the transfer page. Think carefully about what kinds of 
inputs an attacker might provide, and try them out by entering them 
on the transfer page. Please write
down detail descriptions of your observation in <code>bugs.txt</code>.
(You should find at 6 different bugs.)
</div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Fix as many bugs as you can, from those you found
above. Just keep your code as clean as possible. Also
don't forget to test your implementation after you
fix the bugs.
</div>

<h3>Identify Forgery</h3>
As you may have noticed, when you transfer money, you
should fill in the reciever, the currency amount. However, you
don't need to claim who you are. So how does the server
know your identify, even though you've logged in.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Read the source code of the login web page (in your
browser), and the server's
source code. Make sure that you make it clear that how
the server identify who is transferring.
</div>

<p>
To this point, it should be clear to us that we can
fool the server. That is: if we can construct
a fake <code>POST</code> with some specific HTTP body
attributes (what should they be?), and send the request to
the server, we can fool the server that a victim is
transferring
money. And the server will perform the transfer!

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
Try to construct a <code>POST</code> request about
the money transferring, which steal money from some
account if you know the victim's account (it's often
the case). You can use
<code>browser.c</code> or some tools, such as <code>firebug</code> 
to construct the request. Your request may look like
this:
<pre>
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  
  from=Alice&to=Bob&money=100
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Cookie</h3>
Up to now, you can understand
that if very dangerous to use the account name as the
user's identify. So we will introduce you another method: <a href="
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">the cookie</a>. Cookie
is a small piece of data sent from a website to a
user and stored in a user's web browser, while the user is
browsing that website. Every time the 
user loads the website, the browser sends the cookie (automatically)
back to the server to notify the website of the user's previous
activity. Cookies were designed 
to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember state information 
(such as items in a shopping cart) or to record the user's browsing activity 
(including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages 
were visited by the user as far back as months or years ago).

<p>
In this lab, you will design and implement a simple
form of cookie to identify different users. Your cookie will
work as follows (here, we suppose that you are using
some browser, say IE, Firefox, or Chrome. If you are
using your own browser, say <code>browser.c</code>, you
will have to add all the cookie supporting facilities
into your browser, which requires you, nevertheless to say, to
add more code):
<ul>
  <li>when a (valid) user log in, the server will
    send a cookie to the user; the cookie is unique, that is,
    cookies are different from each other;
  <li>if you are using a browser (say, IE or Chrome), the
    cookie will be saved by the browser; so, you don't
    need to worry about what happened under the hood;
  <li>when you continue to visit the server, the cookie
    will be sent, by the browser, to the server;
  <li>the server will check the cookie to find out
    the user's identity.
</ul>

Server will send a response if one logins or registers successfully, which 
include <code>set-cookie: value</code> in the header of response.
<p> 
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Locate the code which handles the post request in <code>handle.c</code>,
and add more code. You may find the response header <code>
Set-cookie: value</code> useful. When one user transfers money, you
should identify the user by cookie. 
</div>

<h1>Part B: Packet Sniffing</h1>
The request sending by the browser will
be transmitted through the network in form of packets, before reaching
the server. As the packet is encoded in plain text, so
it not hard for some adversary to peek the content packet, this is
often called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_sniffer">packet sniffing</a>. If
the packet contains some sensitive information, such as the
username, password, or cookie, the adversary can
steal such information and do evil. In this part of
lab, you will explore how this can happen in practice
and realize the threat.

<p>
To do this, you will be using some tools for
packet sniffing, one of such popular tools are 
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a> 
(formerly Ethereal). The network packet analysis software
functionality in wireshark includes, but not limited to, 
network packet capture, analysis and modification, etc..
Wireshark use WinPCAP as an interface 
directly with the card for data exchange packets.

<p>
Your job here is to use <code>wireshark</code> and steal 
the <code>cookie</code>, then use the cookie to construct your
<code>POST</code> request for transfer some one else's money.
The basic process is shown in the following figure: you
use <code>wireshark</code> to listen your own machine's
network interface card (NIC), which any send or receive packet.

</div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
Using the <code>Wireshark</code> to steal the cookie, and
then use the cookie to make fake <code>POST</code>
request. Send the request to the server and transfer
some one else's money.
</div>

<p>
The above exercise is a little bit ideal, for that in
real world, no one will allow you to install wireshark
on her machine and sniff the packets. However, one attacker
can create more complex environment
to achieve her goal, one sample technique
is the <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP欺騙">ARP
Attack</a>. Even, you can set up a Local Area Network (LAN)
for fishing, just as the following figure shows. In fact, wifi
fishing has becoming more and more popular in recent years.
<p>  
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="./1.jpg" height="300px">
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
According the above description, you can use any one way to
sniff the sensitive packets from the victim, and do something
interesting. (Nevertheless to say, this is illegal in
practice, so you can only do this for study purpose.) 
</div>

<h1>Part C: Encryption</h1>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">Encryption</a>
is the standard way to protect sensitive information
from leaking. Encryption itself does not 
prevent interception, but denies the message content to the
interceptor. In this part of the lab, you will explore
how to use encryption to protect the packets.

<p>
To make things as simple as possible, we recommend you
to use some symmetric-key algorithms, though you are
free to choose any strategy you prefer. Symmetric-key
algorithms
use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption
of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys
may be identical or there may be a 
simple transformation to go between the two keys. The
keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between
two or more parties that can be used to 
maintain a private information link. This requirement
that both parties have access to the secret key is one
of the main drawbacks of symmetric 
key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Encrypt the cookie. You should modify as least
these files: <code>index.html</code>, <code>handle.c</code>, 
and <code>dbutil.c</code> etc..
</div>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">
Asymmetric cryptography</a> now becomes the de-facto
algorithms now. And it's more secure.

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Implement asymmetric encryption in the Touchstone. For
example: change the algorithm
to RSA, or DSA, you can refer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a>
for more details.

<h3>Handin</h3>
This completes the lab. Remember to hand in your solution to 
the information system.
