                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Computer & Network Security: a Hands-on Approach
                                </li>

                            <p>
                                Besides this, we'll also post some papers or reading as supplementary
                                materials. It's very important that you read the textbook or
                                papers in advance. There are also some references and
                                resources on the course web page.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Homework</h3>
                            <p>
                                For each topic we would like to discuss, one question will be
                                asked, you must write your answer to the question on paper, and
                                submit it <b>BEFORE</b> each class. Your answer will <b>NOT</b> be
                                graded, the only purpose of the homework is just to make sure
                                that you have put your best efforts in preparing the class.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Late homeworks will NOT be accepted, for ANY reasons.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Labs</h3>
                            <p>
                                This year's course will be based on a <b>learning-by-doing</b>
                                style, that is, for each topic we discussed, there will
                                be an accompanying lab. The purpose of the lab is for
                                you to gain the hands-on experience of the security
                                problem, its implications, and the possible mitigations.
                                Thus, you gain much deeper understanding and appreciate
                                the practical approach.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Programming assignment should be attempted
                                individually. If you cannot come up with an answer after trying,
                                you may talk about how to solve this problem
                                with your classmates, the instructor, the TAs, etc., but the final
                                submitted work should be your own ones.
                            </p>
