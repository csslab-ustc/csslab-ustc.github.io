                            <p>
                                This year, students enrolled in this course will
                                be required to finish a course project. The goals of the course project
                                include, but not limited to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    to study a new security topic. As security
                                    is growing rapidly and new trends are emerging, so
                                    it's important for us to understand the new
                                    frontiers; and
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    to have an opportunity for you to apply what you
                                    have learned in the class about the basic principals of security
                                    to new problems.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Project Topics</h3>
                            <p>
                                Although there are many new emerging security directions, but to
                                keep us aligned, we will be concentrating on <b>machine learning security</b>
                                this year. If you really want to choose another topic, you
                                should discuss with us before the project and get our approval.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are roughly two directions for machine learning security, we'll
                                give you some references as starting points, but you are
                                free to propose your own ideas:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                is a good starting point;</li>
                                <li>to apply machine learning techniques to security
                                problems: your can start with

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                To inspire ideas, you might also look at recent machine learning
                                security publications
                                from top-tier security conferences, as well as other resources below.

                            <p>
                                You should work in a group of no more than <b>3</b> students. Working
                                individually is allowable but not encouraged, not only for
                                the engineering effort to finish the project is considerable, but also
                                team collaboration is an important skill in security research (and
                                all software development) practice.

                                    If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how?

                                <li>
                                    You don't have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a
                                    general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what
                                    kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)?
                                    Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate
                                    and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                You should submit your proposal before the due date, and you
                                should give an oral presentation of your proposal.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Project Report</h3>
                            <p>
                                Your should finish and submit a write-up as the project report. The
                                report should structured like a paper, using <a href="./ref/security-paper.tex">this template</a>.
                                Please make sure to use this template so that the reports are
                                of the uniform style (fonts, color, spacing, etc..). And we'll post
                                all the reports online, so that you can learn from each other's
                                work. If you don't want to your reports posted, please let us know
                                in advance. Your reports should be written in English (preferred)
                                or Chinese.

                                    why it's important and challenging, and an overview of your results
                                    (and contribution);

                                    that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach
                                    the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative
                                    approaches? You should demonstrate that you have applied
                                    ideas and skills built up during the quarter to tackling
                                    your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures,
                                    diagrams, or tables to describe your method or compare it with other methods.

                                    depending on the project, but you might compare with
                                    previously published methods, perform an ablation study
                                    to determine the impact of various components of your

                                    failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs,

                                The following is a suggested structure for the presentation. You don't
                                necessarily have to organize your presentation using these sections
                                in this order, but that would likely be a good starting point for most projects.
