      (<b>ssedb: a minimal debugger</b>). Debuggers are powerful tools which allow
      programmers to load and run executables, to attach to a already
      running process (even
      remote ones); and perform interesting actions. 
      
      <p>In this problem, you'll learn what's going on under the
      hood of debugging, by implementing a minimal debugger called <code>ssedb</code>
      by yourself. And further, you'll understand how anti-debugging
      techniques can make debugging difficult, and how to overwhele these
      anti-debugging techniques. 
      
      <p>
      Though small, <code>ssedb</code> debugger includes many
      features: loading files, setting up break points, stopping and
      continuing processes, peeking registers
      and memory, poking memory and registers, etc.. And finally, <code>ssedb</code> 
      is also based-on <code>ptrace</code>, as
      do <code>gdb</code>, <code>edb</code> or <code>ida pro</code>, etc..
      
      <p>
        First, download the <a href="ssedb.c">source file</a> of <code>ssedb</code>
        to your Linux machine, along with a trivial <a href="hello.c">testing program</a>. Compile
        these two program files:
        <pre>
          $ gcc -o ssedb ssedb.c
          $ gcc -o hello hello.c
        </pre>
        And then run the debugger on <code>hello</code>:
        <pre>
          $ ./ssedb hello
        </pre>
        And you may try several commands now, for instance, the <code>regs</code> command:
        <pre>
          (ssedb) regs
        </pre>
        will display contents in registers. But note that command names are
        similar but not the same with <code>gdb</code>.
        
       <p>
       Now read the source file <code>ssedb.c</code> and answer the following questions. In
       this process, you may find
       <a href="http://pramode.net/articles/lfy/ptrace/pramode.html">this manual</a> useful.
       
      <ol>
      	<li>How the <code>regs</code> command is implemented?
      	<li>Now, how the breaking point command <code>b addr</code> is implemented?
      	In fact, there is a serious bug in current implementation we offered
      	you. Let's check where is this bug. First run this
      	<pre>
      	$ objdump -d hello
      	</pre>
      	and figure out the address of the function <code>main</code>, suppose
      	that address is <code>0xaddr</code> on your machine. Now in the <code>ssedb</code>,
      	you set up a break point on address <code>0xaddr</code> by typing (remember this
      	address must be in hexadecimal, which has a leading <code>0x</code>):
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) b 0xaddr
      	</pre>
      	and then let the debugger run to hit the break point:
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) c
      	</pre>
      	now peek the registers:
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) regs
      	</pre>
      	What's the value of <code>eip</code>? Is this value right? Why?
      	<p>And then disassembly the content at address <code>0xaddr</code>.
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) x/x 0xaddr
      	</pre>
      	What's there? Have you detected the bug? How to fix this bug?
      	<li>There is also a command to disassembly bianry into assembly
      	intructions, but has not be completed. Now run
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) x/i 0xaddr
      	</pre>
      	you'll see an error message indicating the file position
      	you should supply code. Implement it. (Hint: manual disassemblying
      	is tedious and error-prone, so you may find some libraries are
      	helpful, such as the <a href="http://bastard.sourceforge.net/libdisasm.html">libdisasm</a>.)
      	<li>(<b>Hard</b>.) Another feature missing from the <code>ssedb</code> is debugging
      	symbols. For instance, when setting up breaking points, we'd like just to type
      	a symbolic name, such as:
      	<pre>
      	(ssedb) b main
      	</pre>
      	instead of an ugly hexadecimal address for <code>main</code>. Implement this
      	feature. (Hint: refer to the <a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF.pdf">DEARF</a> debugging format.)
