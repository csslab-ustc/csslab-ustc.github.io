      In its simplest form, a memory allocator allocates and
      de-allocates memory for application; among which the ubiquitous
      ones are C's <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> family. There
      are a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc">production quality allocators</a>
       in widly use. However, writing
      a memory allocator from scratch is difficult and too much work, for
      it must take into account of efficienty, security etc. together. As
      an example, the 
      <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">Doug Lee allocator</a> 
      for GNU glibc consists of more than 6000 lines of C code!
      
      <p>So, for the purpose of studying heap overflow, we wrote
      a dirty simple allocator, which is based loosely on the algorithm
      in K&R's C textbook. Though simple, this allocator is expected
      to fresh your idea on heap management and on what a heap overflow is. 
      Download the allocator <a href="malloc.zip">here</a>, and answer the
      3 questions in file <code>main.c</code>.
