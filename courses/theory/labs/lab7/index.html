<h1>Lab 7: Symbolic execution</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the class, we discussed a specific style for defining
    program semantics: the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics">
        operational semantics</a>, in which a program is executed on
    some
    virtual machines. We also discussed the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution">symbolic execution</a>, which
    is similar to the operational semantics, except for the that
    the program is executed on a symbolic virtual machine and all
    program paths are explored in a systematic way. Finally, we discussed
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concolic_testing">concolic execution</a>,
    in which the program is executed both
    concretely and symbolically.
</p>
<p>
    In this assignment, we'll build several executors: the concrete
    executor, the symbolic executor, and the concolic executor. To
    be specific,
    this assignment is divided into four parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and problems. The first part is about concrete
    execution, in which you'll implement an executor based on the
    big-step operational semantics as we discussed in the class;
    the second part covers symbolic execution;The third part covers concolic
    execution, which combines symbolic execution and concrete execution;
    finally, the last part, we'll be getting some experience of symbolic
    execution application, by applying this technique to a well-understood
    security problem: SQL injection. Some problems are tagged with
    <b>Exercise</b>, which you should solve. And several problems are
    tagged with <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional. Download this
    <a href="./code.zip">code templates</a> to start with.
</p>

<p>
    Before getting started with this assignment, make sure you've finished
    <a href="../lab1/index.html">Software Setup</a> in the
    assignment 1, and have Z3 and Python (3.7+ recommended) properly
    installed on your computer. For any problems, please feel free
    to contact us for help.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files with file
    name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-7.zip</samp> (e.g., SA19225789-lab-7.zip), and
    submit it to
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Online Teaching Platform</a>.
    Any late submission will NOT be accepted.

<h2>Part A: Concrete execution</h2>
<p>
    The idea of concrete execution is straightforward: we build
    a virtual machine to execute the program. And the execution
    rules for the VM follow the operational semantics rules (big or small step,
    depending on the style you choose). In many circumstances, such execution
    engine is often called an interpreter, as we interpret the
    code directly, instead of compiling them to native code.
</p>
<p>
    In this part, we'll build a concrete executor (interpreter)
    for the MiniPy language.
</p>
<p>
    The abstract syntax for MiniPy:
</p>
<pre>
    B ::= + | - | * | / | == | != | > | < | >= | <=
    E ::= n | x | E B E
    S ::= pass
        | x = E
        | seq(S, S)
        | f(E1, ..., En)
        | if(E, S, S)
        | while(E, S)
    F ::= f((x1, ..., xn), S, E)
</pre>
<p>
    where the non-terminal <samp>F</samp> stands for a function, the <samp>(x1, ..., xn)</samp>
    means the function's arguments, the <samp>S</samp> means the statements
    in the function, and the <samp>E</samp> means the return expression of the function;
    The non-terminal <samp>S</samp> stands for a statement; The non-terminal <samp>E</samp>
    stands for an expression; The non-terminal <samp>B</samp> stands for a binary operator.
</p>

<p>
    The concrete executor (interpreter) you'll build will directly execute
    the source code of MiniPy. For this purpose, you'll first build
    data structures to represent the syntax for MiniPy, such data
    structures are called the abstract syntax trees (AST), as we have seen
    several times, for various languages, in the previous assignments.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b> Read the code in <samp>mini_py.py</samp>, which contains
    the AST data structures we have defined for you. To keep thing
    simple (but not simpler),
    we have modified the MiniPy syntax a little bit, the biggest change
    is the removal of the function call statement
    <samp>f(E1, ‚Ä¶, En)</samp>. You will also find that magic
    methods <samp>__str__()</samp> in the <samp>Function</samp> class are not implemented.
    Your task in this exercise is to finish it.
    After finishing your code, don't forget to run the test cases to get the
    desired code-printing result.
</div>

<p>
    In order to build the concrete executor, we first need to define the
    memory model, for this, we'll be using Python's dataclass model.
    We define, in the <samp>concrete.py</samp> file, a Python
    dataclass <samp>Memory</samp> which contains a definition of the
    concrete memory. The memory operations are defined as:
</p>

<pre>
    ùúå:ùë•‚Üíùëõ   concrete_memory: Dict[str, int]    memory model data structure
    ùúå[ùë•‚ä¢ùëõ]  concrete_memory["x"] = n          update the memory, mapping x to n
    ùúå(ùë•):   concrete_memory["x"]              read the binding of variable x
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Read the code in <samp>concrete.py</samp> file, make
    sure you understand the concrete model data structure before continuing.
</div>

<p>
    To implement the concrete executor, we'll be using the
    big-step operational semantics rules. We list the rules
    for statements below:
</p>

<pre>
            œÅ‚ä¢E‚üπn
    -------------------------- (E-Assign)
          œÅ‚ä¢x=E‚üπœÅ[x‚ä¢n]

        œÅ‚ä¢E‚üπ1    œÅ‚ä¢S1‚üπœÅ1                  œÅ‚ä¢E‚üπ0   œÅ‚ä¢S2‚üπœÅ2
    -------------------------- (E-If1) ------------------------- (E-If2)
         œÅ‚ä¢if(E;S1;S2)‚üπœÅ1                  œÅ‚ä¢if(E;S1;S2)‚üπœÅ2

            œÅ‚ä¢E‚üπ0                         œÅ‚ä¢E‚üπ1  œÅ‚ä¢S‚üπœÅ‚Ä≤ œÅ‚Ä≤‚ä¢while(E;S)
    -------------------------- (E-While1) ------------------------------------ (E-While2)
          œÅ‚ä¢while(E;S)‚üπœÅ                         œÅ‚ä¢while(E;S)‚üπœÅ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Read the code in <samp>concrete.py</samp> file, try
    to complete code in the <samp>interpret_stm()</samp> function,
    following the big-step operational semantics rules from the lecture note.
    We have supplied some unit test cases in the
    <samp>test_interpret_exp</samp>, your implementation should pass
    these test cases, and you can also write your own test cases
    to test your code.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: As we mentioned above, there is no support
    for function call/return in current implementation.
    Try to extend the code to support function call/return
    <samp>S::=f(E1, ‚Ä¶, En)</samp>. Think carefully about the memory
    model, you may need to build a call stack.
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Part B: Symbolic execution</h2>

<p>
    In order to generate test cases automatically for any given program,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_A._Clarke">Lori A. Clarke</a> and
    <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/k/King:James_C=.html">
        James C. King</a> proposed symbolic execution in 1976.
    Compared to concrete execution, symbolic execution
    executes the program with the symbolic input and maintains the
    symbolic program state.
</p>
<p>
    Symbolic execution can cover all possible paths of a program.
    For each path, it needs to maintain program states (symbolic memory,
    accumulated path conditions). For branching, the program states
    are forked. The following is an example if-statement:
</p>

<pre>
    def foo():                              parent process
        if e1:                            /                \
            if e11:               fork() /                  \ fork()
                ...                     /                    \
            else:                  e11(e1)                  e12(~e1)
                ...               /      \                  /     \
        else:             fork() /        \ fork()  fork() /       \ fork()
            if e12:             /          \              /         \
                ...        (e1/\e11)   (e1/\~e11)   (~e1/\e12) (~e1/\~e12)
            else:
                ...
</pre>

<p>
    We'll be using Python's <samp>multiprocessing</samp> package to
    do process forking. You can refer to the online
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html">
        document
    </a>
    for details. Here we give some basic usage, which should be enough
    for this lab's purpose:
</p>

<pre>
    # create a sub-process "p" which executes `func` function with two parameters 12 and 20:
    p = Process(target=func, args=(12, 20))

    # start the sub-process p
    p.start()

    # wait sub-process p to finish
    p.join()
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Read the code in <samp>pymp.py</samp> file to
    familiarize yourself with the basic usage of Python's multiprocessing.
    The program in the file will start two timers which
    record the time at different time intervals. It uses
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#pipes-and-queues">
        multiprocessing.Queue
    </a> which allows multiple producers to gather the results.
    You do not need to write any code in this exercise.
</div>

<p>
    During the symbolic execution, we need to maintain symbolic
    memory for all execution paths, unlike
    memory in concrete execution, the symbolic execution will store
    AST nodes instead of actual values in the symbolic memory. Each
    execution branch maintains an
    independent storage area, a Python dataclass <samp>Memory</samp> which
    contains symbolic memory and path conditions.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Read the <samp>symbolic.py</samp> file, make sure
    you understand the dataclass <samp>Memory</samp> before continuing.
</div>

<p>
    The whole process for symbolic execution is very similar to
    concrete execution, except for that the symbolic memory is
    split for branching. Here is an example to
    demonstrate how symbolic memory splits for if statement:
</p>

<pre>
    def foo(x, y):                     x = x, y = y, z = x + y
        z = x+y                              /          \
        if x == 0:                   x == 0 /            \  x != 0
            z = z + 1                      /              \
        return z           x = x, y = y, z = z + 1      x = x, y = y, z = x + y
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6</b>: Read the code in the <samp>symbolic.py</samp> file, try
    to finish the symbolic executor by completing the code in
    the <samp>symbolic_expr()</samp> and <samp>symbolic_stmt()</samp> functions.
    Test your implementation by using the unit test we provided.
</div>

<p>
    When symbolic execution finished, we should get path conditions
    and symbolic memory for each path, convert these path conditions
    to Z3 forms and send them to Z3 solver. The Z3 solver will
    calculate a model for these path conditions (if such a model
    does exist), and this model essentially stands for the concrete
    input that leads the program to this path. The whole process is:
</p>

<pre>
programs ---> symbolic ---> path conditions ---> solver ---> model ---> concrete
              executor        /obligation                               execution
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7</b>: Read the <samp>symbolic.py</samp> file, try to
    complete the <samp>exp_2_z3()</samp> function. This function converts
    path conditions (AST nodes) to equivalent Z3 constraints.
    Don't forget to test your implementation.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: To keep things simple, the current symbolic
    executor does not support the <samp>while</samp> statement. You
    can add support for loops. One option is to finitize the
    loop as we have discussed in the
    lecture. Feel free to try other options.
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Part C: Concolic execution</h2>
<p>
    Concolic execution is the combination of concrete execution and
    symbolic execution. The main idea is to maintain both symbolic memory and
    store path conditions during the concrete execution. By
    negating the path condition, the executor can generate an input which
    leads the program to a different path. Compared to symbolic execution,
    it has at least the following advantages:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Asymptotic execution avoids the problem of path explosion;</li>
    <li>No need to finitize the loops;</li>
    <li>No need to establish a symbolic model for the API calling;</li>
    <li>More flexible when facing difficult constraints.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Concolic execution maintains both a symbolic memory and a concrete
    memory. A Python dataclass <samp>Memory</samp> which
    contains symbolic memory and concrete
    memory is already defined in the <samp>concolic.py</samp> file.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Read code in the <samp>concolic.py</samp> file,
    try to complete the missing code in the function <samp>concolic_stmt()</samp>
    , you need to maintain both a symbolic memory and a concrete
    memory. You can directly use the corresponding functions
    in the <samp>symbolic.py</samp> and <samp>concrete.py</samp> file. The
    <samp>concolic_executor()</samp> function generates next input parameters
    by negating path conditions randomly, you can set
    the threshold the function will execute. Don't forget to test your
    code, for instance, we already know the example
    function <samp>f1()</samp> has three paths.
    Does your concolic executor cover all these paths? How many times
    of trials do your executor take to achieve this?
</div>

<p>
    One benefit of using concolic execution is that it avoids the
    non-termination loop problem, here is the typical process:
</p>
<pre>
    while e:        <------- concrete execution, append to path condition list
        statements  <------- concolic execution
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Continue to read the code in
    the <samp>concolic.py</samp> file,
    try to complete the missing code dealing with the <samp>StmtWhile</samp>
    statement in the function <samp>concolic_stmt()</samp>. You need to append
    the loop judgment expression to the path conditions. After finishing
    this part of code, you
    can try your implementation on the example <samp>func_loop()</samp>. How
    many paths does your implementation cover? How many rounds
    your executor has executed?
</div>

<p>
    Another benefit of using concolic execution is that it will be more
    flexible than symbolic execution when dealing with complex
    constraints. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    def foo(x, y):
        m = x*x*x + x*x + x + 200
        if m == y:
            s = 0
        else:
            s = 1
        return s
</pre>
<p>
    When we process the if-statement, we need to add the constraint
    <samp> x*x*x + y*y*(x-10) + 200 == y </samp> to the path conditions,
    as this constraint is nonlinear and may beyond the capability of
    current state-of-the-art solvers, say Z3.
    In concolic execution, we can weaken this constraint by
    replacing the symbolic value of <samp>m</samp> with its
    concrete value. Suppose the
    values of x and y are 10 and 1, the constraint can be simplified to
    <samp>1300 == y</samp>.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Modify the <samp>concolic.py</samp> file, add checking
    procedure when appending path condition, replace the symbolic
    value by the concrete value if necessary. You have at
    least two strategies
    to determine whether to replace the symbolic value.
    <ol>
        <li>Use a function to determine whether the constraint
            is linear or not, if the constraint is nonlinear,
            perform the replacement. This strategy is rather
            conservative, as some solvers can handle some nonlinear
            constraints.
        </li>
        <li>Be optimistic, try to solve the constraint directly
            but setting some
            timeout (in Z3, this can be achieved
            by: <samp>solver.set("timeout", 500)</samp>). When a timeout
            happens, perform the replacement.
        </li>
    </ol>
    These strategies are not exhaustive, you are free to propose
    your own strategies and try them.
    There is some test example <samp>func_foo()</samp> in the
    file, which you can use to
    test your implementation.
</div>

<h2>Part D: SQL Injection (Optional)</h2>
<p>
    All problems in this part are optional.
</p>
<p>
    In this part of this assignment, we'll be getting some experience of
    symbolic execution application, by applying this technique to
    a well-understood security problem: SQL injection.
</p>

<p>
    Most modern software systems, especially the online transaction
    processing systems (OLTP) make extensive use of databases.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>
    is a code injection technique, used to attack such
    data-driven systems, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted
    for execution.
</p>

<p>
    We have supplied you a very small database application, using
    the Python's <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">sqlalchemy</a>
    toolkit. Read the code in the <samp>sql-injection-sym.py</samp> file,
    run this code, you will see some output like this:
</p>
<pre>
        Please input a user name:
</pre>
<p>
Basically, this file will create a local database <samp>victim.db</samp>
(with SQLite3), with
a predefine table <samp>users</samp>. And there have been some
existing data in this table. (What are these data?)
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 10</b>: Try to input a username <samp>Bob</samp>, you will
    get some output like this:
    <pre>
        Your searched the user:  Bob
        Found a potential SQL injection vulnerability, you may trigger it with:
        [Bob = "hacker' OR '1=1"]
        Found the user: Bob
        [('Bob', 30, 'M')]
    </pre>
    as you can see, besides the normal response: <samp>[('Bob', 30, 'M')]</samp>,
    the symbolic executor also tells you that it detects a SQL injection
    vulnerability. In order to trigger the vulnerability, you should
    input this (crazy username!):
    <pre>
        hacker' OR '1=1
    </pre>
    what output do you get? You don't need to write any code in
    this exercise, but make sure you understand what SQL injection
    is and how it happens.
</div>

<p>
    With the basic knowledge of SQL injection, the key problem
    we'd like to ask here is how we can find out such
    vulnerabilities in practical DB systems, both precisely
    and effectively. One promising way to do this is to use
    symbolic execution, the basic idea here is to run
    the target DB application symbolically (here in this
    problem: concolically),
    and before the DB command get executed, we check the
    symbolic values of the DB queries against some
    well-known payload patterns, to see whether the
    user-controlled input can match the payload pattern. As
    we'll discuss a little later, this syntactic pattern
    matching approach may be too constrained, but it may be
    the simplest one to implement.
</p>

<p>
    To run the DB application symbolically, we use a new
    approach: instead of building an interpreter
    for the DB application from scratch, we intercept the
    Python's string APIs, so that these APIs will calculate
    symbolic values, besides actual values.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 11</b>: Read the class <samp>SymStr</samp>
    in the <samp>sql-injection-sym.py</samp> file,
    try to understand how we intercept the <samp>+</samp>
    APIs on a Python string.
</div>

<p>
    Nevertheless, by using more payload pattern, you
    can detect more SQL injections. For example, you can drop
    the table <samp>users</samp> with some injected SQL command.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 12</b>: Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">
    the background reading</a> on
    SQL injection, and try to figure out what possible
    SQL command
    can be used to drop the table <samp>users</samp> from
    the current database <samp>victim.db</samp>. Justify your
    answer by running this SQL command manually. Add
    a payload pattern in the <samp>payloads[]</samp>
    list, so that your symbolic executor can detect such
    vulnerabilities. Don't forget to test your code.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Though the payload pattern based
    approach is very efficient, it may be overly rigid, in
    the sense that it tries to find out <em>exact</em>
    matching. Try to design a better way to detect SQL
    injection with symbolic execution. A possible starting
    point may be considering Z3's
    <a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorialcontent/sequences#h23">
        regular expression support</a>.
</div>


<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Try to figure out how to fix such SQL
    injection vulnerabilities. You may want to refer to
    some good books or articles on this topic.
