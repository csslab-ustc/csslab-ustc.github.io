<h1>Lab 5: Linear Arithmetic and Linear Programming</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the class, we discussed the theory of linear arithmetic (shortened
    as LA in the following) and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">
        linear programming</a>
    (shortened as LP in the following). Arithmetical constraints are
    ubiquitous
    in every aspect of formal reasoning and (hard)
    problem-solving, and both LA and LP are very powerful tools to establish
    these models and to solve the problems.
</p>
<p>
    From the computer science point of view, most LA and LP problems can
    be solved
    by special-purpose software or libraries (e.g., the
    IBM's very popular
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPLEX">CPLEX</a>).
    However, most modern general-purpose
    solvers/provers also have good enough support for both LA and
    LP, by
    incorporating well-tuned decision procedures for LA/LP over the
    integers, rationals, or real domains. Take Z3 as an example, it has
    <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~nikolaj/programmingz3.html#sec-arithmetic">decent
        support</a> for both LA and LP.
</p>
<p>
    In this lab, you will be familiarizing yourself with the background
    theories
    of LA/LP, with the important applications of LA/LP to real-world
    (hard) problem
    (by using Z3), and with the underpinning algorithms of modern
    provers/solvers
    to solve these problems.
</p>
<p>
    This lab is divided into three parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and problems. The first part introduces the basic
    background and knowledge of LA/LP theory; the second part discusses
    the applications of LA/LP theory, by solving some (NP-Complete hard)
    problems; and the third part covers the algorithm implementation
    including the Fourier-Motzkin variable elimination, and Simplex.
    Some problems are tagged with <b>Exercise</b>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional.

<h2>Part A: Basic Linear Arithmetic Theory</h2>
<p>
    In this section, we will discuss the basic LA/LP theories,
    by using the solver Z3.
</p>

<h3>Basic Linear Arithmetic</h3>
<p>
Recall from the lecture, the syntax for LA is:
</p>

<pre>
    A ::= x | c | c*x
    E ::= A + E | A
    R ::= E = E | E <= E | E < E
    P ::= R | P /\ P
</pre>

<p>
    The solver Z3 has complete support for this syntax, and can solve these
    equalities/inequalities efficiently.
    For example, suppose
    we can have two numbers \(x, y\in \) ℝ, and the following constraints:
    \begin{cases}
    x + y = 0.8 \\
    x - y = 0.2
    \end{cases}
</p>
Then we can declare two Z3 variables and build the solver in Z3 as:
<pre>
    x, y = Reals('x y')
    solver = Solver()
    solver.add([x + y == 0.8, x - y == 0.2])
    res = solver.check()
    if res == sat:
        print(solver.model())
    else:
        print("no solution")
</pre>
<p>
    and Z3 will output the model it finds, if the above constraints
    are satisfiable.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Read the code for this exercise we give in the
    <samp>la-theory.py</samp> Python file, we
    have given all the code for this exercise. Make sure you understand
    the code, and run the code, what's the output?
</div>

<p>
    Of course, not all constraints are satisfiable, for example, consider
    the following constraints on two variables \(x, y \in \) ℤ:
    \begin{cases}
    x + y = 0.8 \\
    x + y = 0.2
    \end{cases}
    where
    $$
    x,y \in ℤ,
    $$
    obviously, these constraints are unsatisfiable.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Read the code for this exercise in the
    <samp>la-theory.py</samp> Python file. Finish this exercise by filling
    in the missing code. Your code should output "<samp>unsat</samp>", if
    your implementation is correct.
</div>

<p>
    Besides the domain real ℝ ("Reals"), Z3 also has decent support
    for the integer domain ℤ. For instance, for two integer
    variables \(x, y \in \) ℤ, this code
</p>
<pre>
    x, y = Ints('x y')
</pre>
<p>
    declares two integers \(x\) and \(y\) in Z3.
    Similarly, we can ask Z3 to check such constraints on Integers, for instance, given
    the following constraints:
    $$
    \begin{cases}
    x + y = 8 \\
    x - y = 2
    \end{cases}
    $$
    where
    $$
    x,y \in \mathbb{Z},
    $$
    and give the model.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Read the code for this exercise we give in the
    <samp>la-theory.py</samp> Python file. Finish this exercise by filling
    in the missing code. What's the output?
</div>

<p>
    One key point to note here is that: when we talk about the
    satisfiability of constraints, we must make it clear what
    domains (ℝ, ℤ, ℚ or others?) we are working on, because the
    satisfiability of constraints is dependent on the underlying
    domain. To understand this, let's consider the following
    example, given these constraints:
    \begin{cases}
    x + y = 8 \\
    x - y = 1
    \end{cases}
    and we can conclude that these constraints are satisfiable on
    domain ℝ, but not on domain ℤ.
</p>


<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Read the code for this exercise we give in
    the <samp>la-theory.py</samp> Python file. Finish this exercise
    by filling in the missing code to check the above constraints
    are satisfiable domain ℝ, but not on domain ℤ.
</div>

<h3>0-1 Integer Linear Arithmetic</h3>

<p>
    There is one important special case for the LA on domain ℤ, which
    is called the 0-1 integer linear arithmetic (or 0-1 ILA). In this case, all
    integer variables can only be of two values: \(0\) or \(1\), in this sense,
    they correspond, perfectly, to boolean values (true or false).
</p>

<p>
    The 0-1 Integer LA (as well as the 0-1 Integer Linear Programming
    we'll be discussing in the following) has many nice properties
    and many important
    applications, we'll discuss some in the following. But for now, let's
    start by considering one interesting problem, to let us appreciate 0-1
    ILA's simplicity and power.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is this: suppose we are given a list \(l\) of integers
    $$
    [e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n],
    $$
    and we are required to write a program, to check whether
    there is at least one zero \(0\) in the list \(l\).
</p>
<p>
    Of course, it's not to write a simple Python program to solve
    this problem. But for our purpose, let's consider how to solve
    this problem using 0-1 integer LA.
    For this, let's first declare a list \(X\) of auxiliary 0-1
    integer variables
    $$
    [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n],
    $$
    which satisfy
    $$
    x_i\in\left\{0, 1\right\}, \text{ for } 1 \le i\le n,
    $$
    and also
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1. \tag{1}
    $$
</p>
<p>
    Informally speaking, there is just one \(1\) in the list
    \(X\). For the given input integer list \(l\)
    (which is being searched for \(0\)s):
    $$
    [e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n],
    $$
    we require
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i*e_i\right) = 0. \tag{2}
    $$
</p>


<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Why the above constraints \((1)\) and \((2)\)
    can guarantee that there is at least one \(0\) in the input list
    \(l\) of integers? You don't need to write code, just
    convince yourself the correctness of these constraints.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6</b>: Fill in the missing code in the function
    <samp>check_zero_la()</samp>, to generate the necessary constraints.
    If your code is right, this function will output something like
    $$
    [x_2 = 0, x_1 = 1, x_3 = 0, x_0 = 0],
    $$
    what does this output imply?
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Using 0-1 ILA, write a program to count
    the number of \(0\)s in
    a given list of integers. For instance, in the list
    $$
    [4, 7, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0],
    $$
    there are <i>three</i> \(0\)s. Don't forget to test your code.
    How does your program behave on large input list?
</div>

<h3>Non-linear constraints and domain \(\mathbb{Q}\)</h3>

<p>
    In previous sections, we've always been talking about the
    linear arithmetics, but many solvers, including Z3, also
    support the satisfiability solving on non-linear constraints.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose we want to check the constraint
    $$
    x * x = 2,
    $$
    we can write (as we may expect):
</p>
<pre>
    x = Real('x')
    res, model = check_cons([x * x == 2])
    if res == sat:
        print(model)
    else:
        print(res)
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7</b>: Write some code to check that this
    non-linear constraint
    $$
        x*x + y*y \lt 0
    $$
    on two real numbers \(x, y \in \) ℝ, is unsat.
</div>

<p>
    One important application of the non-linear arithmetic
    is to reason constraints on rational domain \(\mathbb{Q}\). We
    have studied linear arithmetic both on the real domain ℝ and
    the integer domain ℤ, Z3 has built-in supports for these two domains.
    However, the bad news is that Z3 does not support rational domain
    \(\mathbb{Q}\) directly.
    To mitigate this, we can use a very important
    property of rational numbers: suppose \(x \in \mathbb{Q}\) is a
    rational number, then we have
    $$
    x = p/q \tag{3},
    $$
</p>

<p>
    for
    $$
    q \neq 0,
    $$
    where \(p, q \in \mathbb{Z}\). The formulae \((3)\) can
    be rewritten into
    $$
    x*q = p \tag{4}.
    $$
    Please notice that the equation \((4)\) is also non-linear.
</p>

<p>
    Let's study one example to see how this strategy works in practice,
    consider our previous example once again, we can
    check the constraint
    $$
    x*x = 2 \tag{5}
    $$
    on rational domain \(\mathbb{Q}\), it's unsatisfiable.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Please fill in the missing code to check
    the satisfiability of the above equation \((5)\).

<h2>Part B: LA/LP Applications</h2>
<p>
    In this section, we will study how to establish models and
    solve problems using the LA/LP theories, with the aid of the
    Z3 solver.
</p>
<p>
    To be specific, we'll solve several very hard
    problems, by "hard", we mean that these problems are all
    NP-complete, that is, there are no known polynomial
    algorithms for these problems in general.
</p>
<p>
    However, you will soon
    see that how easy (and how fun) it is to solve these problems
    with LA/LP solvers, such as Z3. And you'll acknowledge the
    power and simplicity of the solver-based problem-solving
    strategy, in general.
</p>
<p>
    The NP-Complete problems that we'll be solving are (some of them have
    been discussed in our previous lectures):
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Subset Sum Problem</li>
    <li>N-queen Problem</li>
    <li>Knapsack Problem</li>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note that this is not a complete list of problems that an
    SMT-based solver can handle, after you have learned this
    technique, you are encouraged to try to solve other NP-Complete
    problems as well.
</p>

<h3>Subset Sum Problem</h3>
<p>
    The subset problem is a well-known satisfiability problem:
    given a multiset (a multiset is like a normal set,
    expect for the elements can be duplicated) \(S\), we should
    decide a non-empty subset \(T\) of \(S\), such that
    $$
        \sum T = 0, \text{ where } T \subseteq S.
    $$
</p>
<p>
    For example, given this set
    $$
        \left\{-7, -3, -2, 9000, 5, 8\right\},
    $$
    the answer is yes because this subset
    $$
        \left\{-3, -2, 5\right\}
    $$
    sums to zero.
</p>
<p>
    This problem is NP-Complete, and for more background information of the
    subset problem, please refer to this article on the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem">
        subset sum problem</a>.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Read the code in the <samp>subset_sum.py</samp>
    Python file, complete the <samp>subset_sum_la()</samp> method which solve
    the subset sum problem using 0-1 ILA. The basic idea is to
    create flag
    \( F \) for each number in the target set \( T \), and we just
    need to add the constraint
    $$
        \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left(F[i]*S[i]\right) = 0,
    $$
    where \(N\) is the length of target set \(S\).
</div>

<p>
    In practice,the subset sum problem can be solved in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time">
        pseudo-polynomial time</a> using
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">
        dynamic programming</a>.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 10</b>: Read the code in the <samp>subset_sum.py</samp>
    Python file, a dynamic programming-based (DP) solution is already
    provided by <samp>subset_sum_dp()</samp> method. And another LA-based
    solution <samp>subset_sum_la_opt()</samp> which is optimized by Z3's
    Pseudo-Boolean constraints is also provided. Try to compare the
    efficiency of the DP, the LA algorithm and the optimized LA algorithm,
    by changing the value of <samp>max_nums</samp> to other values,
    say, 200, 2000, 20000, ..., what's your observation? What conclusion
    you can draw from these data?
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: The DP solution provided in <samp>subset_sum.py</samp>
    file is based on recursion, it may affect the efficiency of
    the algorithm. Try to implement a DP solution without recursion,
    and compare the efficiency of the DP and the LA algorithms.
    what's your observation?
</div>


<h3>N-Queen Problem</h3>
<p>
    In the assignment 3 (challenge problem), we've solved the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">n-queen problem</a>
    (4 Queens) by SAT. The problem is about placing \( N \) chess queens on an
    \( N*N \) chessboard, so that no two queens threaten each other.
    A solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, diagonal
    or anti-diagonal. The following figure shows a solution to the sample
    n-queen puzzle where \( N = 4 \):
    <img src="figures/four_queen.png" style="margin: auto;display:block;" alt="Four Queen">
    The problem's target is try to find how many solutions exist, for
    a \(N*N\) chess board.
</p>
<p>
    The basic idea of SAT implementation is to construct the n-queen puzzle
    constraints by <samp>Bool</samp> values. Actually,we can solve n-queen problem
    by LA, which is much easier to understand and more efficient
    compare to SAT. The idea is same with the solution of subset sum problem.
    We use a two-dimensional 0-1 flag \(F\) to represent each cell of the chessboard,
    the \(F\) has value:
    $$
    F[i][j] =
    \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{if cell in $i$ row $j$ column is not placed a queen}; \\
    1, & \text{if cell in $i$ row $j$ column is placed a queen}; \\
    \end{cases}
    $$
    where \(0 \le i \lt N\) and \(0 \le j \lt N\). We can establish the
    constraints of the n-queen puzzle as follows：
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        each row has just 1 queen:
        $$
        \sum\limits_{j=0}^{N-1}F[i][j] = 1
        $$
        for each \(0 \le i \lt N\);
    </li>
    <li>
        each column has just 1 queen:
        $$
        \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1}F[i][j] = 1
        $$
        for each \(0 \le j \lt N\);
    </li>
    <li>
        each diagonal has at most 1 queen:
        $$
        \sum\limits_{\substack{i-j=d \\ 0 \le i \lt N \\ 0 \le j \lt N}}F[i][j] \le 1
        $$
        for each \(1-N \le d \lt N\);
    </li>
    <li>
        each anti-diagonal has at most 1 queen:
        $$
        \sum\limits_{\substack{i+j=d \\ 0 \le i \lt N \\ 0 \le j \lt N}}F[i][j] \le 1
        $$
        for each \(0 \le d \lt 2N-1\).
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 11</b>: Read the code in the <samp>queen.py</samp> Python file,
    complete the <samp>n_queen_la()</samp> method which solve the n-queen problem
    using 0-1 ILA. You can construct the constraints by referring to the
    models we have discussed above, or you can propose your own
    constraints.
</div>

<p>
    Another method to solve the n-queen problem is to use the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">
        backtracking algorithm</a>, but the complexity is
    exponential with respect to the chess board size \(N\).
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 12</b>: Read the code in the <samp>queen.py</samp>
    Python file, there is a backtracking-based solution in the
    <samp>n_queen_bt()</samp> method. Try to compare  of the backtracking
    and the LA algorithms, by changing the value of the chessboard size
    \(N\) to other values, which one is faster? What conclusion you
    can draw from the result?
</div>

<p>
    The above LA implementation is not the unique algorithm to
    solve n-queen problem. In fact, the way we establish constraints to
    describe a problem often has a big impact on the efficiency
    of the algorithm.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 13</b>: Read the code of the method
    <samp>n_queen_la_opt()</samp> in the <samp>queen.py</samp> Python file.

    implementation in
    <samp>exercise 11</samp>. What's your observation? What conclusion
    you can draw?

    <i>Challenge</i>: Try to run your LA solution to the n-queen problem

<h3>Linear Programming</h3>
<p>
    Generally speaking, a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">
        linear programming problem</a> (shorted as LP
    in the following) consists of
    two parts: the constraints \(C\) and the target function \(F\). And our
    goal is to get the minimal or the maximal values of \(F\)
    under the constraint \(C\). Both the constraints and the
    target function are of linear forms.
    In this part, we will study some LP problems, also with the aid of Z3.
</p>
<p>
    For example, given the constraints
    \begin{cases}
    x &\lt 2 \\
    y - x &\lt 1 \\
    \end{cases}
    we want to calculate
    $$
    \max\left(x + 2y\right).
    $$
</p>
<p>
    To solve LP with Z3, we'll be using the <samp>Optimize</samp> module
    and, to be specific, the
    <samp>maximize()</samp> API. For more details about the
    module and the API, you can refer to the
    <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classz3py_1_1_optimize.html">
        official documents</a>.
</p>

<p>
    For the above example, we can have the following Z3 code:
</p>
<pre>
    x, y = Ints("x y")

    solver = Optimize()
    cons = [x < 2, (y - x) < 1]
    solver.add(cons)
    solver.maximize(x + 2*y)

    if solver.check() == sat:
        print(solver.model())
</pre>

<p>Z3 will output some result like this:</p>
<pre>
    [y = 1, x = 1]
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 14</b>: Read the code in the <samp>linear_programming.py</samp>
    Python file. Run the example and make sure you understand the code.
    Finish the exercise by filling in the missing code to add the
    constraints
    \begin{cases}
    x - y &\ge 2.1 \\
    x + z &\le 5.5 \\
    y - z &\le 1.1 \\
    \end{cases}
    and calculate
    $$
    \max\left(x + y + z\right).
    $$
</div>

<h3>Knapsack Problem</h3>
<p>
    The knapsack problem is a typical optimization problem,which
    has been studied for hundreds of years. The problem is: given
    a set of items, each item has a weight and a value, determine the number
    of items such that the total weight is less than a given limit
    and the total value is as large as possible. There are a
    number of sub-problems
    of the knapsack problem: 0-1 knapsack problem, complete
    knapsack problem, multiply knapsack problem, multidimensional
    knapsack problem and so on. Please refer to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">
        knapsack problem</a>
    to get more information.
</p>
<p>
    Let's discuss 0-1 knapsack problem first, which
    assumes that there is only one quantity per item. In the following,
    we use the following notations:
    \begin{align}
    W: &\text{ item's weight}\\
    V: &\text{ item's value}\\
    C: &\text{ the bag's capacity}\\
    \end{align}
    and we use a flag \(F\) for each item with
    $$
    F[i] =
    \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{if item $i$ is not chosen}; \\
    1, & \text{if item $i$ is chosen}. \\
    \end{cases}
    $$
    To guarantee that the total weight can not
    exceed the bag capacity \(C\), we have
    $$
    \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left(F[i]*W[i]\right) \le C,
    $$
    where \(N\) is the total number of items.
    The goal of our optimization is to maximize the value of
    the chosen items
    $$
    \max\left(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left(F[i]*V[i]\right)\right).
    $$

    method, to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem by using 0-1 ILP.

</div>

<p>
    Another sub-problem of knapsack problem is the complete knapsack
    problem, which assumes that the number of items of all kinds is
    unlimited, your can choose one kind of item any times. So we
    need to declare a variable for each kind of item \(F\) have chosen
    by amount \(A\)：
    $$
        F[i] = A,
    $$
    where \(0 \le i \lt N\) and \(0 \le A\). So the constraint of
    total weight is
    $$
        \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (F[i]*W[i]) \le C,
    $$
    where \(N\) is the total number of the kinds of items.
    The maximal value of the chosen items is
    $$
        \max\left(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (F[i]*V[i])\right).

<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
<p>
    In statistics, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">
    linear regression</a> is a linear approach to modelling
    the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory
    variables (also known as dependent and independent variables).
</p>
<p>
    In recent years, linear regression plays an important role in the
    field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The linear
    regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine learning
    algorithms for its relative simplicity and well-known properties.
    Interested readers can refer to materials on deep learning,
    for instance,
    <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/cs229-notes1.pdf">
        Andrew Ng
    </a>
    gives a nice introduction to linear regression
    from a deep learning point of view (up to page 7).
</p>
<p>
    However, as this is not a deep learning course, so we'll get access
    to the problem from the mathematical point of view. We start
    by studying one concrete example, given the following data
    (in deep learning's terminology, these are called the training data):
    \begin{align}
    X &= [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\\
    Y &= [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0]
    \end{align}
    Our goal is to produce a linear function:
    $$
    y = k*x + b,
    $$
    such that it fits the above data as close as possible, where
    the variables \(k\) and \(b\) are unknown variables.
    By "as close as possible", we use a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">
        least squares method</a>, that is, we
    want to minimize the following expression:
    $$
        \min\left(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (Y[i] - (k*X[i]+b))^2\right),  \tag{6}
    $$
    where \(N\) is the length of \(X\) or \(Y\).
</p>
<p>
    Now the next step is to solve the equation \((6)\) to calculate the
    values for the variables \(k\) and \(b\).
    We will use the Z3 to finish this task, as Z3 also supports some
    non-linear constraint solving.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 18</b>: Read the code in the <samp>linear_regression.py</samp>
    Python file, you need to install the <samp>matplotlib</samp>, <samp>numpy</samp> and<samp>
    scikit-learn</samp> package to run this code. You can install them via PyCharm as we've done
    in <a href="../lab1/index.html">Software Setup</a> of the assignment 1.
    After setting the environments, complete the <samp>lr_training()</samp> method
    to do the linear regression using Z3.
</div>
<p>
    The popular approach used extensively in deep learning is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">gradient decedent</a>
    algorithm, if you're interested in this algorithm,
    the above Andrew Ng's notes contains a nice introduction.
    In most situations, you don't need to re-invent the wheels,
    there are lots of efficient machine learning libraries in
    Python, say, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html">
    the scikit-learn</a>. You can use them directly to finish the task.

    approach and the LP approach which you implemented in exercise 18 by

<h2>Part C: LA Algorithms (Optional)</h2>
<p>
    All problems in this section are optional!
</p>
<p>
    In the lecture, we've discussed three algorithms for solving LA
    constraints: the Fourier-Motzkin variable
    elimination algorithm, the Simplex algorithm, and the branch-bound
    algorithm. In this part of the assignment,
    you will implement the former two of them.
</p>

<h3>
    Preparation
</h3>
<p>
    Before we start implementing the algorithms, let's introduce some
    helpful data structures.
</p>
<p>
    First we need a data structure to describe the inequalities,
    To simplify things here, we assume that all the constraints
    conform to the syntax for LA which is introduced in <samp>Part A</samp>
    section. It means that all the constraints only
    take \(=\) or \(\le\) or \(<\) as relation operator.
</p>

    and try to understand the data structure <samp>Constraint</samp>.
    You may try to write some constraints based on it.
</div>
<p>
    The data structure in the <samp>constraint.py</samp> Python file
    may suitable for describing a proposition in LA theory,but it's really
    not convenient to implement the LA algorithms by using them。Implementing
    a convenient data structure cost you a lot of time. Fortunately,
    some libraries provide us these facilities. To be specific, we'll be using
    the library <samp>pandas</samp>, which is a powerful and easy-to-use
    open source library. By using the <samp>DataFrame</samp> data structure in
    <samp>pandas</samp> to store the LA proposition, we will save a lot of
    engineering efforts.

<h3>Fourier-Motzkin Variable Elimination</h3>
<p>
    The Fourier-Motzkin elimination method, also known as the FME method,
    is a mathematical algorithm for eliminating variables from a system of
    linear inequalities. It can operate on variables from real domains.
    The algorithm can be summarized as the following steps:
</p>

<h4>1. Equation elimination</h4>
<p>
    Assumes we want to solve the proposition \(P\) based on LA theory.
    The first step is find the constraints which contain \(=\) relation operator
    $$
    \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij} * x_j = b_i,
    $$
    and rewrite them to
    $$
    x_p = \frac{b_i}{a_{ip}} -
    \sum_{\substack{1 \leq j \leq n \\ j \neq p}}
    \frac{a_{ij}}{a_{ip}} * x_j. \tag{7}
    $$
    Replace all the variable \(x_p\) in proposition \(P\) by the equation \((7)\).
    It can elimination the equation and all the variable \(x_p\) in proposition \(P\).
    Do this for all the equations in \(P\) and rewrite the proposition \(P\) to
    $$
    \bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij} * x_j \leq b_i.
    $$

    the <samp>elim_equations()</samp> method. Write some test cases for your implementation.
</div>


<h4>2. Unbounded variable elimination</h4>
<p>
    In LA theory proposition \(P\), the variable \(x_p\) have no lower bound
    if all the coefficients of variable \(x_p\) are positive;the variable \(x_p\) have no
    upper bound if if all the coefficients of variable \(x_p\) are negative.
    We call a variable an unbounded variable if it has no upper
    bound or no lower bound,on the contrary, a bounded variable has both
    upper bound and lower bound. Unbounded variables can be simply removed
    from the proposition \(P\) together with all constraints that use them.
    Removing these constraints can make other variables unbounded.
    Thus, this simplification stage iterates until no unbounded variables remain.

    <i>Challenge</i>: Check the <samp>fourier_motzkin</samp> Python file, and complete
    the <samp>elim_unbounded_vars()</samp> method. Write some test cases for your implementation.
</div>

<h4>3. Bounded variable elimination</h4>
<p>
    If there is no unbounded variable in the proposition \(P\), we can choose
    one bounded variable to eliminate. The choice of variables is heuristic,
    we assume that the chosen variable is \(x_q\). We can get an upper
    bound of variable \(x_q\) by
    $$
    x_q \leq \frac{b_i}{\lvert a_{iq} \rvert} -
    \sum_{\substack{1 \leq j \leq n \\ j \neq q}}
    \frac{a_{ij}}{\lvert a_{iq} \rvert} * x_j
    $$
    if \(a_{ij} > 0\), and get one lower bound by
    $$
    x_q \geq \sum_{\substack{1 \leq j \leq n \\ j \neq q}}
    \frac{a_{ij}}{\lvert a_{iq} \rvert} * x_j
    - \frac{b_i}{\lvert a_{iq} \rvert},
    $$
    if \(a_{ij} < 0\). Assume there are \(m\) positive and \(n\) negative
    occurrences of \(a_{ij}\) in proposition \(P\), we can set the upper bounds
    as
    $$
    U_1(x),\dots, U_m(x),
    $$
    and the lower bounds of proposition \(P\) as
    $$
    L_1(x), \dots, L_n(x).
    $$
    Let's continue to assume that there are \(k\) constraints do not
    contain the variable \(x_q\):
    $$
    D_1(x),\dots,D_k(x).
    $$
    We need all the lower bounds smaller than the upper bounds of variable
    \(x_q\) if we want to eliminate it. So we need compare them one by one and
    get the proposition without variable \(x_q\):
    $$
    \left(
    \bigwedge\limits_{j=1}^m
    \bigwedge\limits_{i=1}^n(L_i(x) - U_j(x) \leq 0)
    \right)
    \bigwedge \left(\bigwedge\limits_{r=1}^k D_r(x) \right).
    $$
    After eliminate the bounded variable \(x_q\), if there only have one
    variable left in proposition \(P\), go to step 4. Or else, go back to
    step 2.

</div>

<h4>4. Solve the last variable</h4>
If there is only one variable \(x_r\) in the proposition \(P\), there are three
possibilities for the variable:

<ol>
    <li>if the variable \(x_r\) has no lower bound, we can assume variable \(x_r\)
        has upper bounds as a list of constants
        $$
        U_1,\dots,U_m. \tag{8}
        $$
        We can solve for the range of variable \(x_r\):
        $$
        x_n \le \min(U_1,\dots,U_m);
        $$
    </li>


    <li>if the variable \(x_r\) has no upper bound, we can assume variable \(x_r\)
        has lower bounds as a list of constants
        $$
        L_1,\dots,L_n. \tag{9}
        $$
        We can solve for the range of variable \(x_r\):
        $$
        x_n \ge \max(L_1,\dots,L_n);
        $$
    </li>

    <li>if the variable \(x_r\) is a bounded variable, we can assume variable \(x_r\)
        has upper bounds as formula \((8)\) and has lower bounds as formula \((9)\).
        Check the constraint
        $$
        \max(L_1,\dots,L_n) \leq \min(U_1,\dots,U_m)  \tag{10}
        $$
        first, if the constraint \((10)\) is <samp>False</samp>, the proposition \(P\)
        is <samp>unsat</samp>; if the constraint \((10)\) is <samp>True</samp>,
        we can solve for the range of variable \(x_r\):
        $$
        \max(L_1,\dots,L_n) \leq x_r \leq \min(U_1,\dots,U_m).
        $$
    </li>
    
</ol>

</div>

<p>
    Running an elimination step over n inequalities can result in at most
    \((m^2)/4\) inequalities in the output, if the proposition \(P\) has
    \(m\) constraints and \(n\) variables. Thus running the successive steps
     can result in at most \(m^{2^n}/4^n\) complexity.
</p>



<h3> Simplex </h3>
<p>
    Simplex algorithm is originally developed to solve the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear programming (LP)</a>
    problems by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig">George B. Dantzig</a>
    in 1947, and SMT for LA is a sub-problem of LP in which there is no the optimization
    goal. The key idea of Simplex algorithm
    can be divided into the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Construct the auxiliary tableau with constraints. The auxiliary tableau
        is a sheet with column and row names, a sample tableau looks like the following:
    $$
        \begin{array}
        {r|r}
          & x_0 & x_1 \\
        \hline s_0 & 1.0 & 1.0 \\
        \hline s_1 & 2.0 & -1.0 \\
        \hline s_2 & -1.0 & 2.0 \\
        
        \end{array} \tag{11}
    $$
    </li>
    
    
    <li>Checking if each additional variable violates the constraint. If not,
           return basic variables as solutions. If there is a violation, find a
           suitable basic variables and pivot it with additional variables.
    <p>
        The pivot operation performs a key role in this step. For
        example, if we want pivot \(s_0\) and \(x_0\) in the tableau \((11)\).
        The first step of the pivot operation is to solve the row of \(s_1\) for
        \(x\):
        $$
        s_0 =  x_0 + x_1 \Leftrightarrow x_0 = s_0 - x_1;
        $$
        This equality is now used to replace \(x\) in the other two rows:
        $$
        s_1 =  2(s_0 - x_1) - x_1 \Leftrightarrow s_1 = 2s_0 - 3x_1;
        $$
        $$
        s_2 =  -(s_0 - x_1) + 2x_1 \Leftrightarrow s_2 = -s_0 + 3x_1.
        $$
        Tableau \((11)\) is rewritten as
        $$
        \begin{array}
        {r|r}
        & s_0 & x_1 \\
        \hline x_0 & 1.0 & -1.0 \\
        \hline s_1 & 2.0 & -3.0 \\
        \hline s_2 & -1.0 & 3.0 \\
    
        \end{array}
        $$
        
    </p>

                        pivot(si, xj);
                        update additional var
                    }
