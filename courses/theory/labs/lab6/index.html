<h1>Lab 6: Theories for Data Structures</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the class, we've discussed several important theories to
    reason about data structures:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit vectors</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">arrays</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">
        pointers</a>. etc., which are widely used in practical
    reasoning and verifications.
</p>
<p>
    In this assignment, you'll be familiarizing yourself with
    these theories, with the reasoning of practical data
    structures, using Z3's support for these theories. To be
    specific, this assignment is divided into three parts, each
    of which contains both some tutorials and problems. The first
    part is about the theory of bit vectors; the second part covers
    theory of arrays; and the third part covers the theory about
    pointers. Some problems are tagged with <b>Exercise</b>, which
    you should solve. And several problems are tagged with
    <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional.
    Download <a href="lab6-code.zip">this code templates</a> to start with.
</p>

<p>
    Before getting started with this assignment, make sure
    you've finished <a href="../lab1/index.html">Software Setup</a>
    in the assignment 1, and have Z3 and Python (3.12+ recommended)
    properly installed on your computer. For any problems, please feel
    free to contact us for help.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files with file
    name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-6.zip</samp> (e.g., SA19225789-lab-6.zip), and
    submit it to
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Online Teaching Platform</a>.
    Any late submission will NOT be accepted.

<h2>Part A: Bit vectors</h2>
<p>
    A bit vector is a very compact data structure with every
    bit 0 or 1, in a fixed constant width \(l\):
    $$
    b_{l-1}, \ldots, b_0
    $$
    where \(b_0\) is the least-significant bit, and \(b_{l-1}\)
    is the most significant bit.
</p>
<p>
    Bit vectors support a large group of operations, as we will
    discuss in the following. So from the data structure point
    of view, a bit vector is a concrete data type (CDT).
</p>

<h3>Basic properties</h3>

<p>
    To build the models and reason the properties of bit vectors, Z3
    has built-in support for bit vectors, for instance, the
    following code:
</p>
<pre>
    x, y = BitVecs('x y', 2)
    solve(x+y==9)
</pre>
<p>
    declares two variable bit vectors <samp>x</samp> and <samp>y</samp> with
    fixed-width \(2\), then asks Z3 whether the equality
    <samp>x+y==9</samp> can be satisfiable.
    And Z3 will generate the result.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1: </b>Run this code for this exercise we give in
    the <samp>bit_vectors.py</samp> Python file, what output do you get?
    Is the number "9" representable using just 2 bits? And explain
    to yourself how the modulo semantics work here. You don't
    need to write any code here.
</div>

<p>
    Z3 has a very rich set of operations for bit vectors,
    you can refer to the
    <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classz3py_1_1_bit_vec_ref.html">
        official APIs</a>.
    For your convenience, here is a table containing most operations:

<h3>Integer overflows</h3>
<p>
    As bit vectors have only fixed width, so they have
    very different properties from the normal mathematical
    integers (with arbitrary width), hence, it's very
    tricky to reason about bit vectors.

    Recall that in the class, we discussed a buggy
    version of the binary search algorithm reported
    by <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">
    Joshua Bloch</a>. The bug is demonstrated by the
    following Java code:
</p>
<pre>
    // To search the value "target", in the input array "arr".
    // Return the index when searching succeeded, or return -1 when failed.
    // This is the implementation in an early version of the "java.util.Arrays"
    int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target){
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while(low <= high){

    Integer overflows are a notorious source of bugs and are very difficult to

<h2>Part B: Arrays</h2>
<p>
    Z3 has a very rich set of operations for arrays, you can
    refer to the
    <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">
    official APIs</a>.
    For your convenience,
    here is a table containing most operations:
</p>
<table border="1" style="text-align: center">
    <tr>
        <td>
            Definition
        </td>
        <td>
            Operations
        </td>
        <td>
            Sample code
        </td>
    </tr>
    <!-- arithmetic operations -->
    <tr>

        <td>
            Store(Array, index , value)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Get a value from array:
        </td>
        <td>
            Select
        </td>
        <td>
            Select(Array, index)
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    In the following, you'll often need to refer to
    this table when necessary.
</p>
<p>
    In order to formulate a programme of a mathematical theory for computation,
    McCarthy proposed a basic theory of arrays as characterized by the
    select-store axioms. The expression
    $$
    Select(A, i) \tag{B1}\label{B1}
    $$
    returns the value stored
    at position \(i\) of the array \(A\); and the expression
    $$
    Store(A, i, v) \tag{B2}\label{B2}
    $$
    returns a new array identical to the original array \(A\), except for
    on position \(i\) it contains the value \(v\). In
    Z3Py, we can write expression \(\eqref{B1}\) as <samp>Select(Array, index)</samp> or
    <samp>Array[i]</samp>, and  write  expression \(\eqref{B2}\) as
    <samp>Store(Array, index, value)</samp>.
</p>

<p>
    Now look at the following code:
</p>
<pre>
    # Use I as an alias for IntSort()
    I = IntSort()
    # A is an array from integer to integer
    A = Array('A', I, I)
    x = Int('x')
    print(A[x])
    print(Select(A, x))
    print(Store(A, x, 10))
    print(simplify(Select(Store(A, 2, x+1), 2)))
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 13</b>: Read the code above and run the <samp>array_test()</samp>
    method it in <samp>array.py</samp>, try to get familiarize yourself with
    the basic usage of Array in Z3. For more details, you may want to

    </a>
    documents.
</div>

<p>
    In class, we've discussed the formula:
    $$
    Store(A, i, x)[i] \ge x \tag{B3}\label{B3}
    $$
    In order to validate it, we can make use of the array support
    in Z3 directly.

<div class="question">

    in the <samp>array.py</samp> Python file, make it can prove formulae \(\eqref{B3}\)
</div>

<p>
    In class, we also discussed the array property, which poses some
    restrictions on the possible shape of index, etc. One implication
    of the array property is that some array formulae are undecidable. For
    instance, the formulae like the following
    $$
    Store(A, i*i - i*i, x)[0] \ge x \tag{B4}\label{B4}
    $$
    is undecidable, as it contain non-linear arithmetic. In general,
    for such formulae, Z3 may not solve it and will return the result
    <samp>unknown</samp>.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 15</b>: Read the <samp>array_non_linear_proof()</samp> method in
    <samp>array.py</samp> Python file. Try to convert formulae \(\eqref{B4}\) into
    a Z3 constraint and investigate the output. Is the result <samp>unknown</samp>?
    Explain your observation.
</div>
<p>
    In the class, we've discussed that the array interfaces can be
    implemented by reducing these interfaces to functions.
    To understand this, you'll implement a small array module
    by using anonymous function: lambdas, in Python.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 16</b>: Read the <samp>lambda_array()</samp> method in

<h2>Part C: Pointers</h2>
<p>
    Z3 hasn't built-in support for pointer structure. In this part, we'll design
    and implement a translator which converts pointer logic into EUF and
    array problem. After translation, we can use Z3 to solve the target formulae.
</p>

<p>
    Before implementing the translator, we need to design the structure of pointer
    logic first. Recall the syntax of pointers we mentioned in the lecture is:
</p>
<pre>
    T ::= x | T + E | &x | &*T | *T | NULL
    E ::= x | n | E + E | E - E | *T
    R ::= T = T | T < T | E = E | E < E
    P ::= R
        | ~R
        | P ∧ P
</pre>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 17:</b> Read the code in <samp>pointer.py</samp>, try to
    understand how to represent the above syntax using Python. And
    finished <samp>count_stars()</samp> method which count amount of star symbols (*)
    in our pointer logic. Test your implementation by the unit test provided.
</div>

<p>
    Next step is the translating procedure, The basic idea is to eliminate
    pointers
    by encoding their semantics using the store <samp>S</samp> and the heap <samp>H</samp>.
    We'll be using the semantics of pointers discussed in the lecture to do the
    elimination.
    Here are the rules to eliminate a pointer \(T\):
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    [\![x]\!]   &= H(S(x)) \\
    [\![T + E]\!] &= [\![T]\!] + [\![E]\!] \\
    [\![\&x]\!] &= S(x) \\
    [\![\&*T]\!] &= [\![T]\!] \\
    [\![*T]\!] &= H([\![T]\!]) \\
    [\![{\tt NULL}]\!] &= 0
    \end{align*}
    $$
    Here are the rules to eliminate an expression \(E\):
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    [\![n]\!]   &= n \\
    [\![x]\!]   &= H(S(x)) \\
    [\![E + E]\!] &= [\![E]\!] + [\![E]\!] \\
    [\![E - E]\!] &= [\![E]\!] - [\![E]\!] \\
    [\![*T]\!] &= H([\![T]\!])
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    Here are the rules to eliminate a relation \(R\):
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    [\![E = E]\!] &= [\![E]\!] = [\![E]\!] \\
    [\![E < E]\!] &= [\![E]\!] < [\![E]\!] \\
    [\![T=T]\!] &= [\![T]\!] = [\![T]\!] \\
    [\![T < T]\!] &= [\![T]\!] < [\![T]\!]
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    And finally, here are the rules to eliminate a proposition \(P\):
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    [\![P \land Q]\!] &= [\![P]\!] \land [\![Q]\!] \\
    [\![\neg R]\!] &= \neg [\![R]\!]
    \end{align*}
    $$
</p>
<p>
    For instance, the formulae:
    $$
        ((p = \&a) \land (a = 1)) \to (*p = 1)
    $$
    will be translated into the following EUF (with application ->, but
    does not matter):
    $$
        (H(S(p)) = S(a)) \land (H(S(a)) = 1) \to (H(H(S(p))) = 1),
    $$
    where the \(H\) and \(S\) are uninterrupted functions.
    The uninterrupted functions are decided by the memory model we use.
    In exercise 8, we assume that the heap <samp>H</samp> only contains the
    <samp>Integer</samp> type, and the address is also of <samp>Integer</samp> type.
    So, the uninterrupted functions \(H\) and \(S\) can be defined in z3:
</p>
<pre>
    S = Function("S", IntSort(), IntSort())
    H = Function("H", IntSort(), IntSort())
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 18:</b> Based on the semantics of pointers logic above,
    finish the <samp>to_z3()</samp> methods in the
    file <samp>pointer.py</samp> to generate Z3 constraints.
    Test your implementation by the unit test provided.
</div>

<p>
    To simplify the problem, our implementation assumes that the heap
    <samp>H</samp> only
    contains <samp>Integer</samp> type, and we represent memory address
    using <samp>Integer</samp> type, though simple and enough to model
    many practical problem, this model is a little bit coarse.
    To model practical memory more accurately, we can design
    a fine-grained
    memory model, thus we can reason more fancy properties of the memory.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge: </i> Try to implement pointer logic which variables can
    take difference
    types. We can partition the heap <samp>H</samp> into at least three
    regions: address's heap,
    real number's heap, integer number's heap, with each partition storing
    variables of different types. You can start with the code in <samp>pointer.py</samp>,
    or you can write your own code from scratch.
