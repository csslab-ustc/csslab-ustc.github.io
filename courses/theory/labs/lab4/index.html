<h1>Lab 4: Theory of EUF</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this lab, you will be familiarizing yourself
    with the theory of equality and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterpreted_function">
    uninterpreted functions</a> (EUF), using Z3.
</p>
<p>
    This lab is divided into two parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and exercises. The first part covers some basic
    SMT problems for EUF; and the second part is about building a
    translation validator for a simple optimizing compiler.
    Some problems are tagged with <samp>Exercise</samp>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional.
    Download <a href="lab4-code.zip">this code template</a> to start with.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files with file
    name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-4.zip</samp> (e.g., <samp>SA19225789-lab-4.zip</samp>),
    and submit it to
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Online Teaching Platform</a>.

<h2>Part A: Basic EUF theory</h2>
<p>
    In this part, let us start to learn how to solve basic SMT
    problems in EUF theory with Z3.
    To declare an uninterpreted function and term, you can declare
    a new sort, and terms and functions on that sort:
</p>

<pre>
    S = DeclareSort('S')
    e = Const('e', S)
    f = Function('f', S, S)
    g = Function('g', S, S, S)
</pre>
<p>
    the above code declared a new abstract sort <samp>S</samp>, and a
    term <samp>e</samp> on <samp>S</samp>, and a function <samp>f</samp> with
    signature <samp>S->S</samp>, that is, function <samp>f</samp> accepts
    argument of type <samp>S</samp>, and returns a value of type <samp>S</samp>.
    And function <samp>g</samp> is very much like the function <samp>f</samp>, except
    for function <samp>g</samp> accepts two arguments, both of them are
    type <samp>S</samp>.
</p>

<p>
    With the above declarations, we can ask Z3 to solve EUF constraints.
    For example, running the following Z3 constraints
</p>
<pre>
    solve(e != e)
    solve(e == f(e))
    solve(e == f(g(e, e))
</pre>
<p>
    will generate the following output:
</p>
<pre>
    no solution
    [e = S!val!0, f = [else -> S!val!0]]
    [e = S!val!1, g = [else -> S!val!0], f = [else -> S!val!1]]
</pre>
<p>
    which indicates that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        the first constraint has no solution;
    </li>
    <li>
        the second constraint has a solution that the variable
        <samp>e</samp> is equal to a constant <samp>S!val!0</samp>; and
    </li>
    <li>
        the third and final constraint has a solution that
        the variable <samp>e</samp> is equal to the constant
        <samp>S!val!1</samp>, the function <samp>g</samp> and
        <samp>f</samp> maps all arguments to the constants
        <samp>S!val!0</samp> and <samp>S!val!1</samp>, respectively.
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="required">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Find <samp>euf.py</samp> file and run it.
    Explain the output to yourself.
</div>

<p>
    The most important rule to reason about EUF is the congruence rule:
</p>
<pre>
            s1=t1      ...      sn=tn
    ------------------------------------------- (Congruence)
         f(s1, ..., sn) = f(t1, ..., tn)
</pre>

<p>
    which is often used to prove the equivalence of different
    implementations of the same algorithm. In the class, we discuss
    such an example to calculate the integer powers, in the following
    exercise, you'll be implementing the equivalence of the two
    algorithms.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Finish the code in the <samp>equiv.py</samp> file,
    to prove the equivalence of the two algorithms.
</div>

<h2>Part B: Translation validation</h2>

<p>
    In this
    part, you'll be implementing a translation validator for an optimizing
    compiler for a small language.
</p>

<p>
    A compiler is a software translating a program in a source language
    into an equivalent program in a target language. For example,
    a C compiler may translate source C programs into functional
    equivalently x86 target programs.
    Furthermore, an optimizing
    compiler will optimize the program during the translation, in order
    to improve the code (e.g., to improve execution efficiency
    or to reduce code size).
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, a compiler is one of the most important pieces
    of the software stack, which we must guarantee the high confidence
    of its correctness. For this purpose, we can engineer a
    verified compiler, like the <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr">CompCert</a>,
    in which every phase of a compiler is mechanically
    proved to be correct.
    Though this approach offers a very high confidence of correctness,
    the engineering effort is considerable, due to the fact that
    a significant amount of the
    correctness proofs must be carried out manually.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, a translation validation approach does not try to
    the correctness of the translation, but to try to validate the output
    from <em>each</em> compiler run is equivalent with the input
    program. This can be summarized in the following figure:
</p>
<pre>
    input(source program) ---> compiler translation ---> output(target program)
      |                                                       |
      ------------------------> translation validator <--------
</pre>
<p>
    It is not hard to see, this is weaker than the fully verified approach, because
    we do not prove that the compiler is fully correct, but just verify
    the output of each compiler run. Though this is a lightweight approach, the
    key advantage of this approach is this can be fully automated, saving
    considerable engineering efforts.
</p>


<h3>The Source Language</h3>
<p>
    In this part of the lab, the source language we want to compile is
    called <samp>Calc</samp>, which
    is a shorthand for the <em>calculator</em> language. The context free
    grammar for this language is given by:
</p>
<pre>
    bop ::= + | - | * | /
    E   ::= x | E bop E
    S   ::= x=E
    F   ::= f(x1, ..., xn){S;* return E;}
</pre>
<p>
    The non-terminal <samp>bop</samp> stands for a binary operator,
    consisting of a bunch of syntactic forms: addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, and division.
</p>
<p>
    The non-terminal <samp>E</samp> stands for an expression, consisting
    of a basic variable <samp>x</samp>, or binary operation.
</p>
<p>
    A statement <samp>S</samp> contains only
    one syntactic form: the assigment.
</p>
<p>
    A function <samp>F</samp> has list of statements <samp>S</samp>,
    followed by a return statement.
</p>
<p>
    The first step is to encode the syntax in Python, this is included
    in the <samp>calc.py</samp> file.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Read the <samp>calc.py</samp>
    and <samp>counter.py</samp> files. Your task is to finish
    the pretty printing function <samp>pp_func</samp>,
    <samp>pp_stm</samp> and <samp>pp_exp</samp>.
</div>

<p>
    As we discussed in the class, in order to reason about programs in
    this language, we should convert programs in this language into
    static single assignment form, or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a>.
    SSA conversion, generally speaking, is a little
    tricky to do, but for the purpose of this language <samp>Calc</samp>,
    the conversion is not very complicated, as <samp>Calc</samp> does not
    contain control-flow
    constructs. The key algorithm is to generate a fresh variable name
    for each variable being assigned to, and rewrite expressions to
    refer to the latest variable names.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Continue on the <samp>calc.py</samp> file, and
    make sure you understand the functions <samp>to_ssa_func()</samp>,
    <samp>to_ssa_stm()</samp>, and <samp>to_ssa_exp()</samp>.
    We have provide you all code, so that you do not need to write any code.
</div>

<p>
    Once we have the SSA form, we can generate Z3 constraints on that form.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Continue on the <samp>calc.py</samp> file, and
    make sure you understand the functions <samp>gen_cons_func()</samp>,
    <samp>gen_cons_stm()</samp> and <samp>gen_cons_exp()</samp>.
    You don't need to write any code.
</div>


<h3>The Target Language</h3>
<p>
    Now let us continue to discuss the target language. The language
    we defined is called <samp>Tac</samp>, which stands for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code">three address code</a>,
    one of the popular compiler
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate languages</a>.
    The context free grammar for Tac is presented below:
</p>
<pre>
    S ::= x=y | x=y+z | x=y-z | x=y*z | x=y/z
    F ::= f(x1, ..., xn){S;* return x;}
</pre>
<p>
    a statement <samp>S</samp> consists of several syntactic forms:
    variable assignment, addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    As the grammar shows: one
    essential feature of Tac is that all computation are atomic, that is,
    expressions are not nested.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6</b>: Read the <samp>tac.py</samp>,
    and make sure you understand the data structures <samp>Stm</samp>
    and <samp>Function</samp>
    for defining the syntax of <samp>Tac</samp>. Please finish
    the pretty printing method <samp>pp_func</samp>,
    <samp>pp_stm</samp>, and <samp>pp_exp</samp>.
    After finishing this part of code, do not forget to test your implementation.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7</b>: Continue on the <samp>tac.py</samp> file, and
    finish the SSA conversion function <samp>to_ssa_func()</samp>,
    <samp>to_ssa_stm()</samp>, and <samp>to_ssa_exp()</samp>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Continue on the <samp>tac.py</samp> file, and
    finish the Z3 constraint generation functions <samp>gen_cons_func()</samp>,
    <samp>gen_cons_stm()</samp>, and <samp>gen_cons_exp()</samp>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<h3>The Compiler</h3>
<p>
    Having both the source language <samp>Calc</samp> and the target language
    <samp>Tac</samp>, we can now implement a compiler translating from
    a source program to
    a target program. The compiler implementation is in the file
    <samp>compiler.py</samp>, with three key functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><samp>compile_func(): </samp> to compile a function;</li>
    <li><samp>compile_stm(): </samp> to compile a statement;</li>
    <li><samp>compile_exp(): </samp> to compile an expression;</li>
</ul>


<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Finish the compiler implementation by
    filling in the missing code
    in <samp>compile_func()</samp>, <samp>compile_stm()</samp>, and
    <samp>compile_exp()</samp> in the source file <samp>compiler.py</samp>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<p>
    Now, we have finished the implementation of the compiler, we can
    implement the translation validator for the compiler. Essentially, a
    translation validator will check the equivalence of the constraints
    generated from the source program and the target program generated
    by the compiler.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 10</b>: Finish the translation validator in
    <samp>compiler.py</samp> by
    filling in the missing code in the function
    <samp>translation_validation()</samp>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Scaling the translation validation techniques to
    real production optimizing compilers like GCC or LLVM.
    You can first extend the source
    and target languages, by supporting more language features; then you
    will extend your compiler. Although the principle is essentially
    the same, the compiler being validated will get complicated
    to support more
    language features. You can take a look at
    <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/tv_pldi00.pdf">this paper</a>
    to get some ideas. (Note that in different translation validators,
    the notion of program equivalence may be different.)
