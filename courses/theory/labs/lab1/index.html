  <h1>Lab 1: Software Setup</h1>
  <hr />

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this course, there will be (roughly) one lab per lecture. The
    purpose of these assignments is to familiarize you with the main
    course topic. One novel point is that all these assignments will
    be finished in a mechanized way, that is, you will finish them
    using some tools. The tools used in this course are Python, Z3, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the first lab, in Part A, you are required to
    install all the necessary tools and software, and have some ideas
    of how they work and how to use them. In Part B, you're going to
    solve several problems as a Python warming up. Some problems are tagged
    with <samp>Exercise</samp>, which you should solve. And one problem
    is tagged with <samp>Challenge</samp>, which is optional.
    Download <a href="lab1-code.zip">this code template</a> to start with.
    For any problems, feel free to ask the TAs for help.
  </p>

  <h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
  <p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files (exclude .venv and other temporary folder)
    with file name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-1.zip</samp> (e.g., <samp>SA19225789-lab-1.zip</samp>),
    and submit it to <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Online Teaching Platform</a>.
    Any late submission will <b>NOT</b> be accepted.
  </p>

  <h2>Part A: Preparation</h2>
  <p>
    In this part, you'll install all the necessary tools and software,
    and have some ideas of how they work and how to use them.
  </p>

  <h3>Python Installation</h3>
  <p>
    In this course, we recommend you to use the Python as main (we'll
    be using the Python binding to send out the assignments. Of course, there
    are other bindings for Z3, say OCaml or .Net bindings, if you want to
    use these bindings, talk to the TAs in advance). You can download Python installation
    package from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official site</a>.
    We recommend Python 3.12.0 or higher version, but if you want to manage multiple
    versions of Python, try <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a>
    or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/">
    anaconda</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>tips:</b> if you are using Windows, please remember add your Python binary to the
    PATH environment. The figure below demonstrates what you should do at installation time:
  </p>

  <h3>PyCharm Installation</h3>
  <p>
    PyCharm is one popular Python IDE, it can effectively manage your Python
    development environment. You can download PyCharm from the
    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">official website</a>.
    you can use the community edition for free or register an account with your
    USTC email to get education-free license for professional edition.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the PyCharm has installed, you can start Python project by open the given
    code template folder:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create project with exist folder, and select the code template folder which given:
    <img src="figures/pycharm-create.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

    <li>Select project interpreter in preferences page:
    <img src="figures/pycharm-setting.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

    <li>Select Python 3.12, which you installed earlier:
    <img src="figures/python-select.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

  </ol>

  <h3> Z3Py Installation </h3>
  <p>
    Z3 is a theorem prover/solver from Microsoft Research.
    In this course, you'll solve SAT & SMT problems using Z3,
    and also you will have the opportunity to solve
    many realistic problems using Z3: say, program verification, symbolic execution,
    reversing engineering from information security, and so on.
    For more information about Z3, you can check its
    <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">project homepage</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Z3Py package is the Z3 API in Python (Z3 also has APIs for C, .Net, and OCaml).
    The next steps show you how to install Z3Py package on PyCharm project:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>To speed up Python packages installation, you can try set the pip source to 
      USTC mirror (https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple)
    <img src="figures/pip-setting.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

    <li>Search z3-solver package and install it:
    <img src="figures/z3-solver.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

    <li>Search setuptools package and install it:
    <img src="figures/setuptools.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>
    </li>

  </ol>

  <h2>Part B: Python Warming Up</h2>
  <p>
    Python is a widely used programming language and is easy to learn and use.
    Given that most of our assignments are composed in Python, it is recommended 
    to allocate some time for familiarizing yourself with the language 
      if you haven't already.
    <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">the basic syntax</a> or
    <a href="https://www.runoob.com/python/python-tutorial.html">the Python tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b> find <samp> python_warmup.py </samp> code file, 
    try to understand the Python code in the file, comments can help you 
    understand it better. Feel free to modify the code and play with it, 
    have fun with Python!
  </div>

  <p>This and the future assignments will use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"> AST (abstract syntax tree) </a>
    to encode formal languages. To let you get familiarized yourself with the creation and 
    operations on AST.In this part, you'll implement a very simple arithmetic calculator in Python.
  </p>

  <p>
    The syntax for the calculator language is described by the
    following context-free grammar (CFG):
  </p>
  <pre>
    exp ::= num
          | exp + exp
          | exp - exp
          | exp * exp
          | exp / exp
          | (exp)
  </pre>
  <p>
    The expressions generated from the CFG above can be represented
    by trees. For instance,
    the expression <samp>3 * 4 + 10 / 2</samp> to AST like:
  </p>
  <pre>
                +
              /   \
             /     \
            *       /
           / \     /  \
          /   \   /    \
         3    4  10     2

  </pre>
  <div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2:</b> find the<samp> calculator.py </samp> code template, 
    and fill in the missing data structures in it. You also need to
    implement the <samp>__str__()</samp> method in these
    classes to print the necessary information. Make sure your code
    pass the unit tests 1&2.
  </div>

  <p>
    Based on the AST data structures, we can implement various computations on the AST.
    One special and important operation you'll be building is an interpreter. Simply
    speaking, an interpreter reads in some program as input, and output its
    result. Consider again the example <samp>3 * 4 + 10 / 2</samp>, the interpreter
    will output <samp>17></samp>.
  </p>
  <div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3:</b> Finish the interpreter by filling in the missing
    code in the <samp>eval_value()</samp> function. 
    Don't forget to test your code using unit tests 3&4.
  </div>

  <div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i> For simplicity,our test cases are written by AST manually. In most cases,
    AST is generated by processing source code file, the programme do these work called lexer
    and parser. Try to implement a lexer/parser that reads the algebraic expressions from a file and
    generates the AST automatically. Consider to use
    <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/LanguageParsing">some tools</a>, if you don't
    want to write everything from scratch.
  </div>

  <h2>Part C: Z3 Warming Up</h2>
  <p>
    To make sure you have installed Z3 correctly, we provide a simple
    test case for you to test your installation. View this simple
    logical proposition.
    And we want to get the solution that make it satisfiable (i.e.,
    let it be <b>True</b>):
  </p>

  <pre>
      P /\ Q</pre>

  <p>
    If Z3 is installed correctly, z3_test.py will run without any
    error and the output should look like:
  </p>
  <img src="figures/z3_success.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" alt=""/>

  <div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4:</b> find the <samp>z3_warmup.py</samp> code file, try to understand 
    the code with the help of the comments. Feel free to modify the code and play with it, 
    have fun with Z3!
  </div>

  After finished the lab, don't forget zip you code files 
  with file name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-1.zip</samp> (e.g.,
  <samp>SA19225789-lab-1.zip</samp>), and submit it to
