<h1>Lab 3: SAT</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In logic or computer science, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">
    Boolean Satisfiability Problem</a> (abbreviated
    as SAT in this assignment) is to determine whether a given propositional
    logic formulae is true, and to further determine the model which makes
    the formulae true.
    The program or tool to answer the SAT problem is called an SAT solver.
    In this assignment, we'll learn how a SAT solver works and how to
    encode propositions and check its satisfiability by such SAT solvers. And
    as applications, we
    will also learn how to model practical problems by satisfiability, and
    thus solve them with the aid of SAT solvers.
</p>
<p>
    There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">
    many SAT/SMT solvers</a>
    available, each with
    its pros and cons. The solver we'll be using in this assignment is
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_Theorem_Prover">
    Z3 theorem solver/prover</a>,
    developed by Microsoft Research. There is no special reason for
    us to choose Z3, any other SAT solvers will also be OK, but
    Z3's Python APIs will be very convenient.
</p>
<p>
    This lab is divided into four parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and exercises. The first part is the SAT encoding of
    the basic propositions; the second part covers validity checking; part three
    covers the DPLL algorithm implementation; and the fourth part covers
    some SAT applications.
    Some problems are tagged with <samp>Exercise</samp>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional.
    Download <a href="lab3-code.zip">this code template</a> to start with.
    For any problems, feel free to ask the TAs for help.
</p>

<p>
    Before starting with this assignment, make sure you've finished
    <a href="../lab1/index.html">Software Setup</a> in the
    lab 1, and
    have Z3 and Python properly installed on your computer.
    For any installation problems, please feel free to contact us for help.
    As we'll be using Z3's Python-based API; you may find it useful to
    refer to the <a href="https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm">
    z3py tutorial</a> and the documentation for
    <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">Z3's Python API</a>.

<h2>Part A: Use Z3 as solver</h2>
<p>
    In the <a href="../lab2/index.html">lab 2</a>, we've learned how to
    declare propositions in z3py and prove their validity. But in most cases,
     Z3 is used as a solver. In this section, we'll learn how to solve propositions
     by using Z3py.
</p>

<h3>Usage of <tt>solve():</tt></h3>
<p>
    <b>Example A-1:</b> The simplest usage for Z3 is to feed the
    proposition to Z3 directly, to check the satisfiability, this can be
    done by calling the <samp>solve()</samp> function,
    the <samp>solve()</samp> function will create an instance of solver,
    check the satisfiability of the proposition,
    and output a model if that proposition is satisfiable, the code looks like:
</p>
<pre>
    F = Or(P, Q)
    solve(F)
</pre>
<p>
    For the above call,  Z3 will output something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    [P=True, Q=False]
</pre>
<p>
    which is a model with assignments to proposition
    <samp>P</samp> and  <samp>Q</samp> that
    makes the proposition  <samp>F</samp> satisfiable. Obviously, this is just
    one of several possible models.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example A-2:</b> Not all propositions are satisfiable, consider this
    proposition:
</p>
<pre>
    F = And(P, Not(P))
    solve(F)
</pre>

<p>
    Z3 will output:
</p>
<pre>
    no solution
</pre>
<P>
    which indicates that the proposition <samp>F</samp> is not satisfiable,
    that is, the proposition F cannot be true for any possible values of
    <samp>P</samp>.
</p>

<h3>Obtain More Possible Solutions:</h3>
<p>
    Consider again <samp>example A-1</samp> in the previous:
</p>
<pre>
    F = Or(P, Q)
    solve(F)
</pre>
<p>
    By default, Z3 only outputs the first row in the truth table:
<p>
<pre>
    <b>P</b>    <b>Q</b>    <b>P\/Q</b>
    -----------------
    t    t     t
    t    f     t
    f    t     t
    f    f     f
</pre>

<p>
    After all, we're asking Z3 about the satisfiability of the
    proposition, so one row of evidence is enough.
    What if we want Z3 to output all the assignment of propositions
    that make the proposition satisfiable, not just the first one?
    For the above example, we want the all first 3 rows.
    Here is the trick: when we get an answer, we negate the
    answer, make a conjunction with the original proposition,
    then check the satisfiability again. For the above example:
</p>
<pre>
    F = Or(P, Q)
    solve(F)
    F = And(F, Not(And(P, Not(Q))))
    solve(F)
    F = And(F, Not(And(Not(P), Q)))
    solve(F)
    F = And(F, Not(And(P, Q)))
    solve(F)
</pre>
<p> The output display all 3 possible solutions:</p>
<pre>
    [P = True, Q = False]
    [P = False, Q = True]
    [P = True, Q = True]
    no solution
</pre>

    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Find file <tt>z3_solver.py</tt> in the code templates and 
    finish the exercises in it.
</div>

<h2>Part B: SAT And Validity</h2>

<p>
    In Exercise 1, we've learned how to use Z3 to obtain the solutions that
    make a given proposition satisfiable. In this part, we continue to
    discuss how to use Z3 to check the validity of propositions. Recall
    in exercise 2, we once used solver to prove the validity of
    propositions, so this is another strategy.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example B-1: </b>As we've discussed in previous lecture, the
    relationship between the validity and satisfiability of a proposition
    <samp>P</samp> is established by:
</p>
<pre>
    valid(P) <==> unsat(~P)
</pre>
    Let consider our previous example:
<pre>
    F = Or(P, Q)
    solve(Not(F))
</pre>

<p>
    Z3 will output the following solution:
</p>
    <pre>
    [P = False, Q = False]
</pre>
<p>
    the fact that <samp>~F</samp> is satisfiable means that the proposition <samp>F</samp>
    is not valid. By this, it should be very clear how to use
    solvers like Z3 to prove the validity of a proposition.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example B-2: </b> Now we try to prove the
    double negation law (<samp>~~P -> P</samp>) is valid:
</p>

<pre>
    F = Implies(Not(Not(P)), P)
    solve(Not(F))
</pre>

    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Find file <tt>z3_sat.py</tt> in the code templates and 
    finish the exercises in it.
</div>

<h2>Part C: The DPLL algorithm</h2>
<p>
    In the lecture, we've discussed the DPLL algorithm. In this part of the
    assignment, you are required to implement the DPLL algorithm. Roughly
    speaking, to implement this algorithm, there are several technical
    steps: first, we should represent the proposition syntax by some
    abstract syntax; second, we should implement all the functions:
    <ul>
    <li><samp>ie(P)</samp>: to eliminate the implications in the proposition <samp>P</samp>;</li>   
    <li><samp>nnf(P)</samp>: to convert the proposition <samp>P</samp> into negation normal form;</li>
    <li><samp>cnf(P)</samp>: to convert the proposition <samp>P</samp> into conjunction normal form;</li>
    <li><samp>dpll(P)</samp>: to calculate the satisfiability <samp>P</samp> of the proposition <samp>P</samp>;</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Fill the missing code in the <samp>to_z3()</samp>,<samp>ie()</samp>,
    <samp>nnf()</samp>, <samp>conf()</samp> function in the <tt>dpll.py</tt> file. 
    Don't forget to test your code using unit tests.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <b>Challenge</b>: Implement the DPLL algorithm, you can start with the <samp>dpll()</samp>
    function in the <tt>dpll.py</tt> file. Test your implementation by using
    unit tests.
</div>

<p>
After finishing this algorithm to experiment how large propositions your
algorithm can solve. For instance, you can generate some very large
propositions using <a href="src/monster.py">this generator</a> and feed
the generated propositions to your solver.
</p>

<p>
How to make you DPLL more efficient, one idea to make your solver
concurrent. To be specific, for the splitting step, to the two
cases, instead of using two sequential calls, we can create two
threads/processes to do concurrent calls.
</p>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i> Implement the concurrent DPLL algorithm.
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Part D: Applications</h2>
<p>
    In the previous part we've discussed how to obtain solutions and prove the
    validity for propositions, and implemented the DPLL algorithm. In this part,
    we will try to use Z3 to solve some practical problems.
</p>
<p>
    Usually when engineers design circuit layouts, they need do some
    verifications to make sure those layouts will not only output a
    permanent electrical signal since it's useless. We want to guarantee
    that the layouts can output different signals based on the inputs.
</p>
<img src="figures/circuit_layout.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: auto" class="center" alt="Circuit Layout">
<p>
    As the graph above shows, there are three kinds of logic gates used in
    design circuit layout, And, Or, Not. And there four inputs in the graph,
    A, B, C and D.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Convert the above into logical
        propositions and then use Z3 to find the solutions.
        Please complete the corresponding part in <tt>circuit.py</tt>.

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Seat Arrangement: Alice, Bob, Carol will take 3 seats.
    But there are some constraints:
    <ul>
        <li>Alice can not sit near to Carol;</li>
        <li>Bob can not sit right to Alice.</li>
    </ul>
    We would like to answer:
    <ul>

    <p>
        Hint: you should not only consider the constraints above, there
        are some implicit constraints, like:
        <ul>
    <li>one person can only take just one seat;</li>
    <li>one seat can only be taken by one person;</li>
    </ul>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i> n-Queens puzzle: now let's consider the famous n-queens
    puzzle. The following figure shows a solution to the sample 4-Queen puzzle.
    <img src="figures/four_queen.jpg" style="margin: auto;display:block;" alt="Seat Arrangement">
    The constraints to the n-queen puzzle are:
