<h1>Lab 8: Hoare logic</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the class, we've discussed the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare logic</a>,
    an axiomatic semantics for formal reasoning about program correctness.
    One important application of Hoare logic is in the field
    of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">program
        verification</a>, where the desired properties of
    the programs can be reasoned formally and rigorously. To be
    specific, there are two different styles to reason about the
    program: the backward style, which scans the program in a reverse
    order and is suitable for the structured programs; and the
    forward style, which scans the program from the beginning
    to the end, and is suitable for either the structured or
    unstructured programs.
</p>
<p>
    In this assignment, you'll implement a Hoare logic system by
    completing both a backward and a forward verification systems.
    To be specific,
    this assignment is divided into two parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and problems. The first part covers a backward
    verification system, which operates on the aforementioned language C--;
    and the second part covers a forward verification system which operates
    on a low-level assembly-like intermediate language TAC, which is
    a modified version of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code">
    Three Address Code</a>. Strictly speaking, these two systems are
    equivalent in their expressiveness, but having both of them will
    get you more familiarized with the different verification technologies
    on different flavors of languages.
    Some problems are tagged with <tt>Exercise</tt>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <tt>Challenge</tt>, which are optional.
    Download <a href="./code.zip">code templates</a> to start with.
</p>

<p>
    Before starting with this assignment, make sure you've finished
    <a href="../lab1/index.html">Software Setup</a> in the
    lab 1, and have Z3 and Python(3.12+ recommended) properly
    installed on your computer. For any problems, please feel free
    to contact us for help.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the lab, zip you code files with file
    name <samp>&lt;ID&gt;-lab-8.zip</samp> (e.g., SA19225789-lab-8.zip), and
    submit it to
    <a href="https://bb.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Online Teaching Platform</a>.
    Any late submission will NOT be accepted.

<h2>Part A: Backward verification</h2>
<p>
    The first verifier you'll be building is of backward style, and
    operates on the C-- language. Below is the syntax of C--, with
    some modifications from last assignment: we add the implication
    <tt>-></tt>, and <tt>&&</tt> , or <tt>||</tt>, and negation <tt>~</tt>:

</p>
<pre>
    bop ::= + | - | * | / | == | != | > | < | >= | <= | -> | && | ||
    E   ::= n | x | E bop E | ~E
    S   ::= skip
          | x=E
          | S;S
          | f(E1, ..., En)
          | if(E, S, S)
          | while I(E, S)
    F   ::= f(x1, ..., xn){S; return E;}
</pre>

<p>
As with last assignment, we need to build a group of abstract syntax
tree data structures to represent the C-- syntax. We have supplied
you these data structures, which you should first get yourself
familiarized of.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1:</b> Read the code in <tt>imp_ast.py</tt>, make sure
    you understand these data structures. Pay special attention
    to the loop invariant and modified variables in the
    <tt>StmWhile</tt> class, and the pre- and post-conditions in the
    <tt>Function</tt> class. Your job in this exercise is to write down
    the data structure for the function <tt>sum()</tt> as given in the
    comment. Make sure to test your implementation before continuing.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2:</b> Later in this assigment (and generally in any
    verification condition generation systems), we often need to
    estimate how large the generated verification condition (an
    expression) is, so we can write a function <tt>exp_num_nodes()</tt>,
    to count the number of nodes in a given expression. Complete
    that function in <tt>imp_ast.py</tt>, by filling in the missing code.
</div>

<p>
    We've discussed the backward verification condition generation
    rules in the class, which are repeated below for your
    reference:
</p>

<pre>
    VC(skip, P)         = P
    VC(S1;S2, P)        = VC(S1, VC(S2, P))
    VC(x=e, P)          = P[x↦e]
    VC(if(e;s1;s2), P)  = (e → VC(s1, P))∧(~e → VC(s2, P))
    VC(while I(e;s), P) = I ∧ (∀x1 x2 ... xn.I →(e → VC(s, I) ∧ (~e → P)))
</pre>

<p>
    Pay special attention to the universal quantifier
    in the rule for the while statement: the variables x1, x2, ..., and xn
    are assigned in the while body. Basically, this rule requires
    the while statement is annotated with the modified variables
    in the loop body. This <tt>StmWhile</tt> class record this
    information in the <tt>modified_vars</tt> field.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Calculate the modified variables in any
    while statement by filling in the function
    <tt>fill_in_modified_vars()</tt> module. You won't need to
    use a functional programming style, instead, you may record
    this information directly on the appropriate tree nodes.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Read the code in <tt>backward.py</tt> file, in
    which the function <tt>vc()</tt> scans a function <tt>f</tt>
    backward, generates
    a verification condition for <tt>f</tt> and returns the verification
    condition. Your task is to fill in this function, based on the
    rules above. Think carefully how to do the variable substitution, and
    how to handle pre- and post-conditions. Make sure to test your
    implementation thoroughly, you can use the test cases in
    the <tt>ast</tt> module. How large the generated VCs are?
</div>

<p>
    As usual, after generating the verification conditions, we continue
    to convert them
    to Z3 format, and send it to the Z3 solver to prove it. If Z3 proves
    the VC, the target program is verified, or else if Z3 reports
    some contradiction, the verification fails. The reason is either
    the program is wrong, or the supplied specification does not
    specify the programs correctly.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Finish the function <tt>vc_2_z3()</tt> in the
    <tt>prover.py</tt> file, to prove or disprove the generated
    verification conditions. Don't forget to test your code.
    Hint: although there can be no decision procedures for
    first-order logic in general, z3 can solve a large set of
    formulas that use quantifiers, say: <tt>ForAll([x, y], f(x, y) == 0)</tt>.
    You'll need this capability when processing the <tt>while</tt> statement.
</div>

<p>
    As we discussed in the class, for target programs with many
    <tt>if</tt> statement, the generated verification conditions
    can grow exponentially, this is called verification condition
    explosion. This brings several challenges to the verification
    system implementation: first, the time spent in the generation
    tends to be longer; second, the generated verification
    condition tends to be larger; finally, the generated VC may
    be beyond the capability of modern solvers.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6</b>: To understand these challenges and to study
    how to mitigate them, we experiment some large target program
    in this exercise. In the file <tt>gen_prog.py</tt>, we provide you
    a generator, which can generate some test programs. You can
    run this command like this:
    <pre>
    <kbd>
        $ python3 gen_prog.py 10
    </kbd>
    </pre>
    to generate a test file, where 10 is number of statements
    you want to generate, you can change it to try other values. This
    command will generate a file <tt>large_prog.py</tt> which contains
    a test program. Run the generated program, and be sure to answer
    the following problems:
    <ul>
        <li>How long does your code take to generate the VC? How to
        speed up this process?</li>
        <li>How large is the generated VC? How to shrink it?</li>
        <li>Is Z3 able to prove this VC? How long does Z3 take to
        finish the task? How to speed up?</li>
    </ul>

</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: In the implementation we supplied, there is no
    support for function calls and returns. Try to modify the code to
    support them. Think carefully the verification generation rules
    for function call/returns. Feel
    free to change any code you think necessary.
</div>

<h2>Part B: Forward verification</h2>

<p>
    In this part of the assignment, we'll build a forward verification
    generator, which scans the program from the beginning to
    the end. The generator you'll build work on an unstructured
    language: TAC, which is an abbreviation of Three Address
    Code, though the version we'll be using is a variant of
    the standard one. The key difference is that the expression
    we'll be using are compound, instead of atomic. Though the
    TAC language here is not suitable for program analysis and
    optimization, it's enough for our verification purpose in
    this assignment.
</p>
<p>
    The intermediate language we'll be using is given by the
    following syntax:
</p>
<pre>
    bop ::= + | - | * | / | == | != | > | < | >= | <= | -> | && | ||
    E ::= n | x | E bop E | ~E
    S ::= skip             // empty
        | x=E              // assignment
        | L:               // label
        | inv E            // an invariant E
        | f(E1, …, En)     // function call
        | if(E, L1, L2)    // branching
        | goto L           // jump
        | return E         // function return
    F ::= f(x1, …, xn){S*}
</pre>

<p>
    Control flows are not structured any more, but only explicit
    labels and jumps.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7:</b> Read the code in <tt>tac.py</tt>, make sure
    you understand these data structures for TAC. Notice that we both
    have the symbolic (label) address and physical address for
    the code sequence. Take the <tt>StmIf</tt> statement as an
    example, the fields <tt>true_label, false_label</tt> are symbolic
    address, whereas the fields <tt>true_address, false_address</tt>
    are physical address. When implementing the symbolic executor, the
    physical address is more convenient, as it allows direct jump.
</div>

<p>
    In principal, we can also write down the TAC programs manually, making
    use of the data structures, as we've done for the C-- programs.
    However, doing so will be painfully and tedious, due to the low-level
    nature of the TAC language. Luckily, there is a more convenient and easier
    way: to compile the C-- programs directly down to equivalent
    TAC program. We have supplied the code for the compiler to you.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Skim the compiler code in <tt>compiler.py</tt>
    file. You are NOT required to understand this code. But you
    are encouraged to do so, if you're curious.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Read the code in <tt>forward.py</tt> file, which
    contains code performing forward verification condition generation.
    Your task in this exercise is to finish this generator by
    filling missing code in the function <tt>vc()</tt>. You'll be
    using the symbolic execution idea from previous assignment.
</div>

<p>
    As in the backward generator, we can send the generated VC to a
    prover/solver to prove it, as described by the following process:
</p>
<pre>
    programs ---> verification         ---> verification ---> solver ---> prove/disprove
                  condition generator       condition
</pre>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: As for the C-- language, add verification
    condition
    generation support for function call/return; so that your generator
    can deal with large programs.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: One key advantage of generating verification
    conditions at a relatively low-level is that one can generate
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-carrying_code">Proof-carrying
    code</a>, in which a explicit formal proof about the VC is
    generated and attached to
    the low-level code. Thus, the receiver of the low-level code
    can re-generate the VC and checks the VC against the proof, to
    guarantee the safety of the code. One such example in common
    use is the Java bytecode: the Java compiler will generate necessary
    type information (among other information) and attach these
    information to the binary class files. Before a client runs
    the class file, it will scan these type information and check
    the type safety of the class file.
    Z3 has builtin support for proof generation, for
    this purpose, you can configure Z3 like this:
    <pre>
        from z3 import *

        ctx = Context(proof=True)
        solver = Solver(ctx=ctx)
        x = Bool('x', ctx=ctx)
        solver.add(Not(Implies(x, x)))
        res = solver.check()
        print(res)
        proof = solver.proof()
        print(proof)
    </pre>
</div>
