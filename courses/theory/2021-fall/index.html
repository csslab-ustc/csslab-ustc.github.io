            <h2>Course Description</h2>

            <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">
            <p>This is an advanced graduate course on formal method
                foundations. The primary goal of this course is to provide students
                with an understanding of the basic concepts of formal methods, and
                their applications in computer science, especially in software modeling,
                computer security and program verification. Roughly, there are six
                board topics will be covered:
            </p>
            <ul class=tag>
                <li>Mathematical logic: propositional, first-order, and second-order</li>
                <li>Dependent type theory: theory and its applications</li>
                <li>Proof theory: including (semi-)automatic theorem proving and
                    practical proof engineering
                </li>
                <li>Functional programming: especially the connection with logic
                    via Curry-Howard isomorphism
                </li>
                <li>SAT and SMT: decision procedures</li>
                <li>Program modeling: Hoare logic, program verification</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Prerequisite: basic discrete mathematics (sets, relations, functions,
                etc..). Some familiarity with
                functional programming is better, but not required.
