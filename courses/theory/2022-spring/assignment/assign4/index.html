<h1>Assignment 4: Proof engineering for predicate logic</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In logic or computer science,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">predicate logic</a>
    is also known as first-order logic or quantificational logic,
    which extends the propositional logic with relations, expressions, and
    quantification.
    The word "predicate" is a statement that
    contains variables (predicate variables), and they may be true or false
    depending on the values of these variables.
    In other words, predicate logic allows the use of sentences that contain
    variables, so that make it possible to model more realistic problems. In
    this assignment, you'll engineer more proofs using Coq.
</p>

<p>
    This assignment is divided into three parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and problems. In the first part, we will
    make some preparations by introducing more tactics from Coq,
    which will get you more familiarized with Coq proof techniques
    for first-order logic.
    The second part covers more proof engineering techniques for
    predicate logic by Coq; and in the third part, we will try more
    complicated proof
    problems.
    Some problems are tagged with <tt>Exercise</tt>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <tt>Challenge</tt>, which are optional.
</p>

<p>
    Before starting with this assignment, make sure you've finished
    <a href="../assign1/index.html">assignment 1</a> and
    have Coq-ide properly installed on your computer.
</p>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
    When you finished the assignment, zip you code files with file
    name <tt>studentid-assignment4.zip</tt> (e.g <tt>SA19225111-assignment4.zip</tt>),
    and submit it to
    <a href="http://yjs.ustc.edu.cn/">Postgraduate Information Platform</a>.
    <!--The deadline is 11:59PM of 15th November 2020 (Beijing time).-->
    Any late submission will <b>NOT</b> be accepted.

<h2>Part A: More Coq Tactics</h2>
<p>
    We have learned several practical Coq tactics in
    <a href="../assign2/index.html">assignment 2</a>. In this section, we will
    try several additional proof strategies and tactics that allow us to
    prove more interesting theorems.
</p>
<h3>Negation: tactic <tt>unfold</tt></h3>
<p>
    Coq uses symbol <tt>~</tt> to represent negation of a proposition.
    <tt>~ P</tt> is a syntactic sugar for <tt>P -> False</tt>, and
    we can build theorems with negations like blow:
</p>

<pre>
    Theorem example_1: forall P: Prop,
        ~(P /\ ~P).
    Proof.
        unfold not.
        intros.
        inversion H.
        apply H1.
        apply H0.
    Qed.
</pre>

<p>
    The <tt>unfold</tt> tactic replaces a term in the goal
    with its definition. For instance, in the above example,
    we use <tt>unfold not</tt> tactic to replaces <tt>~</tt> symbol in the
    goal.
</p>
<img src="example1-1.png" alt="">
<p>
    Also, we can use <tt>unfold t in H</tt> to
    unfold the definition of <tt>t</tt> in the hypothesis with label <tt>H</tt>.
</p>

<div class="question">
        <b>Exercise 1:</b>
        Using the tactic <tt>unfold</tt>, to prove
        DeMorgan law:
    <pre>
        ~(P \/ Q) -> ~P /\ ~Q
    </pre>
</div>

<h3>Tactic <tt>assert</tt></h3>
<p>
    Sometimes, we need to prove our current goal from an intermediate goal.
    The <tt>assert</tt> or <tt>assert (h : H)</tt> tactic
    introduces <tt>H</tt> as a new subgoal; after you prove the
    new goal, you
    can use an assumption <tt>h : H</tt> to prove your original goal. Next
    is an example:
</p>
<pre>
    Theorem example2 : forall P Q: Prop,
        (P /\ ~P) -> Q.
    Proof.
        unfold not.
        intros.
        assert (f : False).
        inversion H.
        apply H1.
        apply H0.
        contradiction.
    Qed.
</pre>
<p>
    Obviously, proposition <tt>(P /\ ~P)</tt> is false, so it can
    imply any proposition. We need to introduce an intermediate goal:
    <tt>(P /\ ~P)</tt> is false.
</p>
<img src="example2-1.png" alt="">
<p>
    Here, we get a new subgoal. After prove this subgoal, we can use it as new
    hypothesis to prove the original goal.
</p>
<img src="example2-2.png" alt="">


<h3>Tactic <tt>destruct</tt> </h3>
<p>
    In assignment 2, we use the <tt>inversion</tt> tactic to break
    conjunction or a disjunction in hypothesis. There another more commonly
    used
    tactic to deal with conjunction and disjunction: the
    <tt>destruct</tt> tactic. This tactic replaces a hypothesis <tt>P /\ Q</tt>
    with two hypotheses P and Q. Alternatively,
    if the hypothesis is a disjunction <tt>P \/ Q</tt>,
    this tactic generates two subgoals: in one P holds and the in the other one Q holds.
    The tactic <tt>destruct</tt> can also generate a subgoal for every
    constructor of an inductive type.
</p>
<pre>
    Theorem example3 : forall P Q: Prop,
        P \/ Q -> (P -> R) -> (Q -> R) -> R
    Proof.
        intros.
        destruct H as [Hp | Hq].
        apply H0 in Hp.
        apply Hp.
        apply H1 in Hq.
        apply Hq.
    Qed.
</pre>
<img src="example3-1.png" alt="">

<p>
    In most cases, the tactic <tt>destruct</tt> works same as
    <tt>inversion</tt>. You can use <tt>destruct H as [H1 H2]</tt> with conjunction
    and <tt>destruct H as [H1 | H2]</tt> with disjunction to make
    your proof more clear.
</p>

<div class="question">
        <b>Exercise 2:</b>
        Using the tactic <tt>destruct</tt>, to prove
    <pre>
       P /\ (Q \/ R) <-> (P /\ Q) \/ (P /\ R).
    </pre>
</div>

<h2>Part B: Predicate Logic</h2>
<p>
    In this section, we'll learn how to prove predicate logic theorems using Coq.
    In Coq, we can declare set variables in the same way as we
    have declared propositional variables:
</p>
<pre>
    Variables A B: Set.
</pre>
<p>
    Here we declared both A and B to be variables for sets.
    Next we declare some predicate variables P and Q on the set A:
</p>
<pre>
    Variables P Q: A -> Prop.
</pre>
<p>
    You can think P and Q as functions taking element from A and returning
    a Prop. If we have an element of <tt>A</tt> set,
    e.g <tt>a: A</tt>, we can use <tt>P(a)</tt> to express <tt>a</tt>
    satisfy
    the property P. Using the same method, we can declare properties relating
    several elements. For example, we can introduce a relation R, relating A and B by:
</p>
<pre>
    Variable R : A -> B -> Prop.
</pre>
<p>
    Here <tt>R a b</tt> expresses a relation on a and b. You can think <tt>R</tt>
    as a function taking two parameters.
</p>

<h3>Universal Quantification</h3>
<p>
    In Coq, the keyword <tt>forall</tt> is used to express universal quantification.
    We can write <tt> forall x: A, P x </tt> to express
    all elements of A satisfy the property P.
    And <tt>forall x: A, P x -> Q x </tt> means that any element of A that satisfies
    the property P will also satisfy the property Q.
</p>
<pre>
    Theorem example4 :
        (forall x: A, P x -> Q x) -> (forall x: A, P x) -> forall x: A, Q x.
    Proof.
        intros H1 H2 a.
        apply H1.
        apply H2.
    Qed.
</pre>
<p>
    We can think this example as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism">Syllogism</a>,
    The major premise is "all A satisfying property P also satisfies
    Q", the minor premise is "all A satisfy property P", the conclusion
    is "all A satisfy Q".
</p>
<p>
    We take several steps to prove this. In the first step, we use the
    tactic <tt>intros</tt> to do the introduction.
    After this step, we get a premise "<tt>a : A</tt>" along with
    two hypothesis H1 and H2.
    The tactic <tt>intro a</tt> introduces an assumption <tt>a: A</tt>
    where each free occurrence of <tt>x</tt> in the goal after <tt>forall</tt>
    is replaced by <tt>a</tt>. So we can see our goal become <tt>Q a</tt>.
</p>
<img src="example4-1.png" alt="">
<p>
    We have hypothesis <tt>H1: forall x: A, P x -> Q x</tt> and we want to prove
    <tt>Q a</tt>, we can use <tt>apply H1</tt> to instantiate the hypothesis <tt>H1</tt>
    to <tt>P a -> Q a</tt>. This will eliminate the implication and we
    only need to prove <tt>P a</tt>. You can check
    <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html#coq:tacn.apply">document</a>
    to understand how tactic <tt>apply</tt> exactly works here.
</p>
<img src="example4-2.png" alt="">
<p>
    We do the elimination for <tt>forall</tt> in the last step. If we know
    <tt>H : forall x: A, P</tt> and we want to show <tt>P</tt> where
    <tt>x</tt> is replaced by <tt>a</tt> we
    use <tt>apply H2</tt> to prove <tt>P a</tt>.
</p>
<img src="example4-3.png" alt="">

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3:</b>
    Try to prove the following predicate logic proposition:
    <pre>
       ∀x.(~P(x) /\ Q(x)) -> ∀x.(P(x) -> Q(x))
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="question">
        <b>Exercise 4:</b>
        Try to prove the following predicate logic proposition:
    <pre>
       ∀x.(P(x) -> Q(x)) -> ∀x.~Q(x) -> ∀x.~P(x)
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="question">
        <b>Exercise 5:</b>
        Try to prove the following predicate logic proposition:
    <pre>
       ∀x.(P(x) /\ Q(x)) <-> (∀x.P(x) /\ ∀x.Q(x))
    </pre>
</div>

<h3>Existential Quantification</h3>
<p>
    In Coq, the keyword <tt>exists</tt> is used to express existential
    quantification. We can write <tt> exists x: A, P x </tt> to express
    there is an element <tt>x</tt> of <tt>A</tt> having the property <tt>P</tt>.
    In the following example:
</p>

<pre>
    Theorem example5 :
        (exists x: A, P x) -> (forall x: A, P x -> Q x) -> exists x: A, Q x.
    Proof.
        intros H1 H2.
        destruct H1 as [a p].
        exists a.
        apply H2.
        apply p.
    Qed.
</pre>
<img src="example5-1.png" alt="">
<p>
    After introducing two hypothesis <tt>H1, H2</tt> into context, we
    need to deal with
    <tt>exists</tt> symbol in the hypothesis and goal. The tactics for
    existential quantification are similar to the ones for conjunction.
    To prove existential statement <tt>exists x : A, Q x</tt>,
    we can assume that the value of <tt>x</tt> that satisfies the existence is
    <tt>a</tt>
    and replace all <tt>x</tt> in <tt>Q</tt> with <tt>a</tt>. In this theorem, we
    have hypothesis <tt>H1:
    exists x : A, P x</tt>, which can be destructed into two hypothesis:
    <tt>a : A</tt> and <tt>P : a</tt>.
</p>
<img src="example5-2.png" alt="">
<p>
    Tactic <tt>exists a</tt> will replace all free occurences of "x" by "a" in
    the goal, it's the elimination of <tt>exists</tt>.
</p>
<img src="example5-3.png" alt="">
<p>
    Last <tt>apply</tt> operation is same with example 4.
