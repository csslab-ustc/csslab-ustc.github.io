<h1>Assignment 2: Proof Engineering in Coq</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this assignment, we'll study how to perform basic (semi-automatic)
  theorem proving with Coq by finishing several exercises.
  These examples will cover basic logical connectives include implication,
  disjunction and conjunction. After finishing the examples, you'll do
  some proofs on your own, these problems will tagged with
  <tt>Exercise</tt>. There are some challenging problems which are
  tagged <i>Challenge</i>, which are optional.
</p>

<p>
  Before starting with this assignment, make sure you've finished
  <a href="../assign1/index.html">assignment 1</a> and
  have Coq properly installed on your computer.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Proof Engineering in CoqIde</h3>
<p>
  CoqIde is a graphical and quite user-friendly tool for Coq.
  To start with, lets open CoqIde and create a file named "<tt>test.v</tt>"
  (note that "<tt>.v</tt>" is the default Coq file suffix).
  Your CoqIde main screen may looks like the figure below:
</p>

<img src="./coqIde.png" style="width: 620px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt=""/>

<p>There are several main windows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>script window: used to open scripts and edit them.</li>
    <li>goal window: where goals to be proven are displayed.</li>
    <li>toolbar: offers basic commands for navigation. For example,
        the down arrow icon is for executing one command onward.
        If that command executes successful, the part of the script
        that has been executed is displayed on a background with
        the processed color; if that command fails, the error
        message is displayed in the message window. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hand-in Procedure</h3>
<p>
  When you finished the assignment, zip you code files with file
  name <tt>studentid-assignment1.zip</tt> (e.g <tt>SA19225111-assignment1.zip</tt>),
  and submit it to
  <a href="http://yjs.ustc.edu.cn/">Postgraduate Information Platform</a>.
  The deadline TBA (Beijing time).
  Any late submission will <b>NOT</b> be accepted.
</p>

<h2>Part A: Coq Tactics</h2>
<p>
  In this section, let's start by learning how to do proof development
  with Coq. At each stage of a proof development, one has a list of goals
  to prove. Initially, the list consists of the theorem itself. After
  applying some tactics, the list of goals contains the sub-goals is
  generated by the tactics.
</p>

<p>The basic structure of Coq theorem:</p>
<pre>
Theorem ident body: type.
Proof.
    Tactics
Qed.
</pre>

<p>in which, some key points deserve further explanations:</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>Theorem</tt> is a command in Coq, basically, it declares a
        new theorem which should be proved;</li>
    <li><tt>ident</tt> is the name for the new theorem;</li>
    <li><tt>body</tt> is the main body for the theorem;</li>
    <li><tt>Proof</tt> starts the proving of the theorem. You need
        give the full poof after it;</li>
    <li><tt>Qed</tt> command completes the proof;</li>
    <li><tt>Tactics</tt> directs the process of proof, where we
      present deduction rules between the goal and premises.
      The <tt>tactics</tt> implement backward reasoning,
      when applied to a goal, a tactic replaces this goal with
      the sub-goals it generates. We say that a tactic reduces a goal
      to its sub-goal(s). For instance, to prove A /\ B,
      We have to prove A and B as sub-goals.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In this section, we'll learn to use these tactics: <tt>intros</tt>,
  <tt>apply</tt>,<tt>inversion</tt>, <tt>split</tt>, <tt>right</tt>
  and <tt>left</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Implication:  <tt>intros</tt> and <tt>apply</tt> tactic</h2>
<p>
  We start with a simple example with only one implication connective (<tt>-></tt>):
  to prove the theorem (which is an axiom) <tt>P -> P</tt>.
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>
<pre>
Theorem example1: forall P:Prop,
    P -> P.
Proof.
    intros.
    apply H.
Qed.
</pre>

<p>
  When we step to the line 3, the goal-window will show as image below,
  our goal is below the horizontal line.
  At this time, it's same with our premises represented in assertion.
  And there is nothing above the horizontal line
  which means local context is empty, we have no premises to use. In natural
  deduction, the judgment is: <tt> Γ |- P -> P </tt>
</p>

<img src="./example1-1.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  Let's step forward one line, execute <tt>intros</tt> tactic. Local
  context will have two premises to use, as image below shows. The <tt>intros</tt>
  tactic have different effect base on current goal, in this example, it
  actually apply the <tt>Introduction Rule of Imply</tt> in natural deduction
  inference rules:
</p>

<pre>
  Γ, P |- Q
--------------- (-> I)
  Γ |- P-> Q
</pre>

<p>
  You can read the
  <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html?highlight=intros#coq:tacv.intros">
  online manual</a> for more information about <tt>intros</tt>.
</p>

<img src="./example1-2.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  Here we got a premise named "<tt>H</tt>", whose value is same with our only sub-goal.
  Just forward to <tt>apply H</tt>, this step will finished the proof.
  So, the <tt>apply</tt> tactic will be useful when you have a premise is the same as the goal.
  The <tt>apply</tt> tactic actually apply the <tt>Var Rule</tt> in natural deduction
  inference rules here:
</p>

<pre>

--------------- (Var)
  Γ, P |- P
</pre>

<img src="./example1-3.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  When goal-window says "No more subgoals", you can finish your proof by using
  <tt>Qed</tt> command, this command will let Coq save the theorem along with
  its proof.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Use <tt>intros</tt> and
    <tt>apply</tt> to prove the below theorem:
    <pre>
        P -> (Q -> P)
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
  We continue to look at our next example:
</p>
<b>Example 2:</b>
<pre>
Theorem example2: forall P Q: Prop,
    (P -> Q) -> P -> Q.
Proof.
    intros.
    apply H in H0.
    apply H0.
Qed.
</pre>

<p>
  This example presents some advanced usage of <tt>apply</tt>.
  After step to the line 4, we got two premises in local context,
  but none of them is same as our goal:
</p>

<img src="./example1-4.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">
<p>
  If we know that x implies y and we know that x is true, we can transform x
  into y in our context using <tt>apply ... in ... </tt> tactic,
  In this example we have premise <tt>H : P -> Q </tt>, and apply it to
  a different premise <tt>H0: P </tt>. It will turn that premise
  into Q. (You can safely think this a function call, although they are different.)
</p>

<img src="./example1-5.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Use tactic <tt>apply .. in ..</tt>, to prove:
    <pre>
        (P->Q) -> (Q->H) -> (P->H)
    </pre>
</div>


<h2>Conjunction: <tt>inversion</tt> and <tt>split</tt> tactic</h2>
<p>
  Here is an example to show how to prove propositions with conjunctions:
</p>


<b>Example 3:</b>
<pre>
Theorem example3: forall P Q: Prop,
    P/\Q -> Q.
Proof.
    intros.
    inversion H.
    apply H1.
Qed.
</pre>

<p>
  Here we will use <tt>inversion</tt> tactic to prove theorem which
  has conjunction connective (<tt>/\</tt> in Coq).
  
  After stepping to the line 4, we have a hypothesis <tt>H : P /\ Q </tt>,
  which has conjunction connective.
</p>
  <img src="./example2-1.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
       alt="">
<p>
  We can use the <tt>inversion</tt> tactics to discover more premises from one
  premise in the context already. In this example, we assume that <tt>P /\ Q</tt> to
  be true, this can be true only if P is true and Q is also true.
  We use <tt>inversion</tt> to make Coq add two more premises (<tt>H0, H1</tt>)
  to the local context.
</p>
<img src="./example2-2.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3:</b> Use the <tt>inversion</tt> tactics to prove the
    following proposition:
    <pre>
        P /\ (P -> Q) -> Q
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
  In the Example 3, we know how to handle conjunction connective
  in the premises. But how about conjunction connective in the
  goal?
</p>

<b>Example 4:</b>
<pre>
Theorem example4: forall P Q:Prop,
    (P /\ Q) -> (Q /\ P).
Proof.
    intros.
    inversion H.
    split.
    apply H1.
    apply H0.
Qed.
</pre>

<img src="./example2-3.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">
<p>
  In this example. we got a goal which contains a conjunction connective <tt>/\</tt>.
  We can use the <tt>split</tt> tactic to split the goal
  into several sub-goals. Then we can prove them one by one.
</p>
<img src="./example2-4.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  The effect of the <tt>split</tt> tactic is same as the <tt>Introduction Rule of Conjunction</tt>
  in natural deduction inference rules:
</p>
<pre>
    Γ |- P                Γ |- Q
  -------------------------------- (/\ I)
            Γ |- P /\ Q
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4:</b> With the new tactic <tt>split</tt>, try to prove:
    <pre>
        (P /\ (Q /\ R)) -> ((P /\ Q) /\ R)
    </pre>
</div>


<h2>Disjunction: <tt>right</tt> and <tt>left</tt> tactic</h2>
<p>
  Now that we've talked about conjunction, let's move on to disjunction：
</p>

<b>Example 5:</b>
<pre>
Theorem example5: forall P Q: Prop,
    (P \/ Q) -> (Q \/ P).
Proof.
    intros.
    inversion H.
    right.
    apply H0.
    left.
    apply H0.
Qed.
</pre>

<p>
  After stepping to the line 5, the <tt>inversion</tt> tactic solve
  disjunction connective in context and generate two sub-goals.
  The two sub-goals have same conclusion but have different <tt>H0</tt>
  value in local context.
</p>

<img src="./example3-1.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  In the first sub-goal, we need to prove <tt>Q \/ P</tt> under the
  hypothesis <tt>H0: P</tt>. As we know if we want <tt>Q \/ P</tt> to be
  true, we just need to prove one (or both) of them be true. So we can use
  <tt>right</tt> tactic to make sub-goal same with our hypothesis <tt>H0</tt>.
</p>

<img src="./example3-2.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  Do the same thing with second sub-goal by <tt>left</tt> tactic, we
  finish all the sub-goals.
</p>

<img src="./example3-3.png" style="width: 1280px; height: auto; padding-left: 40px"
     alt="">

<p>
  The <tt>right</tt> and <tt>left</tt> tactic in Coq correspond to the
  <tt>Introduction Rules of Disjunction</tt> in natural deduction inference rules:
</p>
<pre>
         Γ |- P                          Γ |- Q
  ------------------- (\/ I1)    -------------------- (\/ I2)
       Γ |- P \/ Q                     Γ |- P \/ Q
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5:</b> Use tactic <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> to prove:
    <pre>
        (P \/ (Q \/ R)) -> ((P \/ Q) \/ R)
    </pre>
</div>


<h2>Part B: More Exercises</h2>
<p>
    After learning the usage of these tactics, you can try to prove
    the following exercises.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6:</b> Try to prove:
    <pre>
        ((P -> R) /\ (Q -> R)) -> (P /\ Q -> R)
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7:</b> Try to prove:
    <pre>
        (P -> Q /\ R) -> ((P -> Q) /\ (P -> R))
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Below are some challenging problems, note that all challenges are optional.
</p>
<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i> Try to prove the currying theorem:
    <pre>
        (P /\ Q -> R) <-> (P -> Q -> R)
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge:</i> You may find that examples and exercises we've studied
    do not contain any <tt>not</tt>
    (aka. <tt>~</tt>). Please read the Coq documents and try to prove
    below theorem:
    <pre>
        (P -> Q) -> (~Q -> ~P)
    </pre>
    <b>Hint:</b> You may need a new tactic <tt>unfold</tt>
