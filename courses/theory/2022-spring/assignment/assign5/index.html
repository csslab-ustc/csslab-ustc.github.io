<h1>Assignment 5: Theory of EUF</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In the class, we discussed the theory of equalities and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterpreted_function">
        uninterpreted functions</a>, essentially, the only
    important property of uninterpreted functions is the congruence
    property, which states that two functions are equal if and
    only if two functions are the same, and their corresponding arguments are
    also equal. In this assignment, you'll be familiarizing yourself
    with the basic implementation of equality and uninterpreted
    functions in Z3; and you'll also build a translation validator
    for a very simpler optimizing compiler using the theory
    of equality and uninterpreted functions. In the following of
    this assignment, we'll name theory of equality and uninterpreted
    functions as EUF.
</p>
<p>
    This assignment is divided into two parts, each of which contains
    both some tutorials and problems. The first part is some basic
    SMT problems for EUF; and the second part is about building a
    translation validator for a simple optimizing compiler.
    Some problems are tagged with <tt>Exercise</tt>, which you should solve.
    And several problems are tagged with <tt>Challenge</tt>, which are optional.
</p>

<p>
    Before starting with this assignment, make sure you've finished
    <a href="../assign1/index.html">Software Setup</a> in the
    assignment 1, and
    have Z3 and Python properly installed on your computer. For any
    problems, please feel free to contact us for help.

<h2>Part A: Basic EUF theory</h2>
<p>
    In this section, let's start to learn how to solve basic SMT
    problems in EUF theory with Z3.
    To declare an uninterpreted function and term, you can declare
    a new sort, and terms and functions on that sort:
</p>

<pre>
    S = DeclareSort('S')
    e = Const('e', S)
    f = Function('f', S, S)
    g = Function('g', S, S, S)
</pre>
<p>
    the above code declared a new abstract sort <tt>S</tt>, and a
    term <tt>e</tt> on <tt>S</tt>, and a function <tt>f</tt> with
    signature <tt>S->S</tt>, that is, function <tt>f</tt> accepts
    argument of type <tt>S</tt>, and returns value of type <tt>S</tt>.
    And function <tt>g</tt> is very much like the function <tt>f</tt>, except
    for function <tt>g</tt> accepts two arguments, both of them are
    type <tt>S</tt>.
</p>

<p>
    Given the above declarations, we can ask Z3 to solve EUF constraints,
    as in:
</p>
<pre>
    solve(e != e)
    solve(e == f(e))
    solve(e == f(g(e, e))
</pre>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 1</b>: Download file <a href=code/exercise1.py>exercise1.py</a>
    and run it. Explain the output to yourself. Add any other constraints, and
    explain the output.
</div>

<p>
    The most important rule to connect terms is the congruence rule:
</p>
<pre>
            s1=t1      ...      sn=tn
    ------------------------------------------- (Congruence)
         f(s1, ..., sn) = f(t1, ..., tn)
</pre>

<p>
    Theory of EUF if often used to prove the equivalence of different
    implementation of the same algorithms. In the class, we discuss
    such an example to calculate the integer powers. In the following
    exercise, you'll be implementing the equivalence of the two
    algorithm.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 2</b>: Download and finish the code in the
    <a href=code/equiv.py>equiv.py</a> file, to prove the equivalence of
    the two algorithms.
</div>

<hr>
<h2>Part B: Translation validation</h2>

<p>
    In the class, we discussed about translation validation, in this
    section, you'll implement a translation validator for an optimizing
    compiler for a small language.
</p>

<p>
    A compiler is a software translate a program in a source language
    into the equivalent program in some target language. An optimizing
    compiler will optimize the program during the translation, in order
    to improve the code, for instance, to improve execution efficiency
    or to reduce code size, etc..
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless to say, a compiler is one of the most important pieces
    of the software stack, which we must guarantee the high confidence
    of its correctness. For this purpose, we can engineer a
    verified compiler, like the <a href="http://compcert.inria.fr">CompCert</a>,
    in which every phase of a compiler is proved to be correct.
    Though this approach offers a very high confidence of correctness,
    the engineering effort is very high, due to the fact that all the
    correctness proofs must be carried out manually.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, a translation validation approach does not try to
    the correctness of the translation, but to validate the output
    from <em>each</em> compiler run is equivalent with the input
    program. This can be summarized in the following figure:
</p>
<pre>
    input(source language) ---> compiler translation ---> output(target language)
      |                                                       |
      ------------------------> translation validator <--------
</pre>
<p>
    It's not hard to see, this is weaker than the fully verified approach, because
    we don't prove that the compiler is free of bugs, but just verify
    the output of each compiler run. Though this is a lightweight approach, the
    key advantage of this approach is this can be fully automated.
</p>
<p>
    The source language we want to compile is called <tt>Calc</tt>, which
    is a shorthand for <tt>Calc</tt>ulator language. The context free
    grammar for this language is given by:
</p>
<pre>
    bop ::= + | - | * | /
    E   ::= x | E bop E
    S   ::= x=E
    F   ::= f(x1, â€¦, xn){S;* return E;}
</pre>
<p>
    the non-terminal <tt>bop</tt> stands for an binary operator,
    we have a bunch of syntactic forms: the addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, and division.
</p>
<p>
    the non-terminal <tt>E</tt> stands for an expression, we have a bunch
    of syntactic forms: a basic variable <tt>x</tt>, binary operation
    of two expressions.
</p>
<p>
    The non-terminal <tt>S</tt> stands for a statement, there is only
    one syntactic form: the assigment.
</p>
<p>
    A function <tt>F</tt> has a sequence of arguments: <tt>x1, ..., xn</tt>, and
    its function body consists of a sequence of statement <tt>S</tt>,
    followed by a return statement, and the return statement always
    returns a variable <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    The first step is to encode the syntax in Python, this is included
    in the <tt>calc.py</tt> file.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 3</b>: Download and read through the
    <a href=code/calc.py>calc.py</a> and <a href=code/counter.py>counter.py</a> file,
    and make sure you understand the data structure <tt>Expr</tt>, <tt>Stmt</tt>
    and <tt>Function</tt>. You don't need to write any code.
</div>

<p>
    As we discussed in the class, in order to reason about programs in
    this language, we should convert programs in this language into
    static single assignment form, or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a>.
    SSA conversion, generally speaking, is a little
    tricky to do, but for the purpose of this language <tt>Calc</tt>, the conversion
    is not very complicated, as <tt>Calc</tt> does not contain control-flow
    constructs. The key algorithm is to generate a new variable name
    for each variable that gets assigned to, and rewrite expressions to
    refer to the newly created variable names.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 4</b>: Continue on the <tt>calc.py</tt> file, and
    make sure you understand the functions <tt>to_ssa_func()</tt>,
    <tt>to_ssa_stmt()</tt> and <tt>to_ssa_expr()</tt>.
    You don't need to write any code.
</div>

<p>
    Once we have the SSA form, we can get Z3 constraints on that form.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 5</b>: Continue on the <tt>calc.py</tt> file, and
    make sure you understand the functions <tt>gen_cons_func()</tt>,
    <tt>gen_cons_stmt()</tt> and <tt>gen_cons_expr()</tt>.
    You don't need to write any code.
</div>

<p>
    Now let's continue to discuss the target language. The language
    we defined is called <tt>Tac</tt>, which is a shorthand for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code">three address code</a>,
    this is one of the popular compiler
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate languages</a>.
    The context free grammar for Tac is presented below:
</p>
<pre>
    S ::= x=y | x=y+z | x=y-z | x=y*z | x=y/z
    F ::= f(x1, ..., xn){S;* return x;}
</pre>
<p>
    there are several forms for a statement <tt>S</tt>: the variable assignment, the addition,
    the subtraction, the multiplication, and the division. As the grammar shows: one
    essential feature of Tac is that all computation (expressions) are atomic.
</p>
<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 6</b>: Download and read through the <a href=code/tac.py>tac.py</a>,
    and make sure you understand the data structures <tt>Stmt</tt> and <tt>Function</tt>
    for defining the syntax of <tt>Tac</tt>. Please finish
    the magic method <tt>__str__</tt> in <tt>Stmt</tt> and <tt>Function</tt>.
    After finishing this part of code, don't forget to test your implementation.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 7</b>: Continue on the <tt>tac.py</tt> file, and
    finish the SSA conversion functions <tt>to_ssa_func()</tt> and
    <tt>to_ssa_stmt()</tt>. Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 8</b>: Continue on the <tt>tac.py</tt> file, and
    finish the Z3 constraint generation functions <tt>gen_cons_func()</tt> and
    <tt>gen_cons_stmt()</tt>. Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<p>
    Having both the source language <tt>Calc</tt> and the target language
    <tt>Tac</tt>, we can now implement the compiler from the source to
    the target. The compiler implementation is in the file <tt>compiler.py</tt>,
    there are roughly three functions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>compile_func(): </tt> to compile a function;</li>
    <li><tt>compile_stmt(): </tt> to compile a statement;</li>
    <li><tt>compile_expr(): </tt> to compile an expression;</li>
</ul>


<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 9</b>: Finish the compiler implementation by filling in the missing code
    in <tt>compile_expr()</tt> in the source file <a href=code/compiler.py>compiler.py</a>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<p>
    Now, we have finished the implementation of the compiler, we can
    implement the translation validator for the compiler. Essentially, a
    translation validator will check the equivalence of the constraints
    generated from the source program and the target program generated
    by the compiler.
</p>

<div class="question">
    <b>Exercise 10</b>: Finish the translation validator in <tt>compiler.py</tt> by
    filling in the missing code in the function <tt>translation_validation()</tt>.
    Test your implementation when finished.
</div>

<div class="challenge">
    <i>Challenge</i>: Scaling the translation validation techniques to
    real production optimizing compilers. You can first extend the source
    and target languages, by supporting more language features; then you
    will extend your compiler. Although the principal is essentially
    the same, the compiler will get complicated for supporting more
    language features. You can take a look at
    <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/tv_pldi00.pdf">this paper</a>
    to get some ideas. (Note that in different translation validators,
    the notion of program equivalence may be different.)
